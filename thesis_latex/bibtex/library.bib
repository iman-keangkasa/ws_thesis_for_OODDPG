abstract = {We present a new method for generating collision-free paths for robots operating in changing environments. Our approach is closely related to recent probabilistic roadmap approaches. These planners use preprocessing and query stages, and are aimed at planning many times in the same environment. In contrast, our preprocessing stage creates a representation of the configuration space that can be easily modified in real time to account for changes in the environment, thus facilitating real-time planning. As with previous approaches, we begin by constructing a graph that represents a roadmap in the configuration space, but we do not construct this graph for a specific workspace. Instead, we construct the graph for an obstacle-free workspace, and encode the mapping from workspace cells to nodes and arcs in the graph. When the environment changes, this mapping is used to make the appropriate modifications to the graph, and plans can be generated by searching the modified graph. In this paper, we first discuss the construction of the roadmap, including how random samples of the configuration space are generated using an importance sampling approach and how these samples are connected to form the roadmap. We then discuss the mapping from the workspace to the configuration space roadmap, explaining how the mapping is generated and how it can be encoded efficiently using compression schemes that exploit redundancy in the mapping. We then introduce quantitative robustness measures and show how these can be used to enhance the robustness of the roadmap to changes in the environment. Finally, we evaluate an implementation of our approach for serial-link manipulators with up to 20 joints.},

abstract = {Path planning in the presence of dynamic obstacles is a challenging problem due to the added time dimension in the search space. In approaches that ignore the time dimension and treat dynamic obstacles as static, frequent re-planning is unavoidable as the obstacles move, and their solutions are generally sub-optimal and can be incomplete. To achieve both optimality and completeness, it is necessary to consider the time dimension during planning. The notion of adaptive dimensionality has been successfully used in high-dimensional motion planning such as manipulation of robot arms, but has not been used in the context of path planning in dynamic environments. In this paper, we apply the idea of adaptive dimensionality to speed up path planning in dynamic environments for a robot with no assumptions on its dynamic model. Specifically, our approach considers the time dimension only in those regions of the environment where a potential collision may occur, and plans in a low-dimensional state-space elsewhere. We show that our approach is complete and is guaranteed to find a solution, if one exists, within a cost suboptimality bound. We experimentally validate our method on the problem of 3D vehicle navigation (x, y, heading) in dynamic environments. Our results show that the presented approach achieves substantial speedups in planning time over 4D heuristic-based A*, especially when the resulting plan deviates significantly from the one suggested by the heuristic.},

abstract = {In this paper we develop reduced-order models for the unsteady lift on a pitching and plunging aerofoil over a range of angles of attack. In particular, we analyse the pitching and plunging dynamics for two cases: a two-dimensional flat plate at $\mathit{Re}= 100$ using high-fidelity direct numerical simulations and a three-dimensional NACA 0006 aerofoil at $\mathit{Re}= 65\hspace{0.167em} 000$ using wind-tunnel measurements. Models are obtained at various angles of attack and they are verified against measurements using frequency response plots and large-amplitude manoeuvres. These models provide a low-dimensional balanced representation of the relevant unsteady fluid dynamics. In simulations, flow structures are visualized using finite-time Lyapunov exponents. A number of phenomenological trends are observed, both in the data and in the models. As the base angle of attack increases, the boundary layer begins to separate, resulting in a decreased quasi-steady lift coefficient slope and a delayed relaxation to steady state at low frequencies. This extends the low-frequency range of motions that excite unsteady effects, meaning that the quasi-steady approximation is not valid until lower frequencies than are predicted by Theodorsen's classical inviscid model. In addition, at small angles of attack, the lift coefficient rises to the steady-state value after a step in angle, while at larger angles of attack, the lift coefficient relaxes down to the steady-state after an initially high lift state. Flow visualization indicates that this coincides with the formation and convection of vortices at the leading edge and trailing edge. As the angle of attack approaches the critical angle for vortex shedding, the poles and zeros of the model approach the imaginary axis in the complex plane, and some zeros cross into the right half plane. This has significant implications for active flow control, which are discussed. These trends are observed in both simulations and wind-tunnel data.},

abstract = {Generating smooth and continuous paths for robots with collision avoidance, which avoid sharp turns, is an important problem in the context of autonomous robot navigation. This paper presents novel smooth hypocycloidal paths (SHP) for robot motion. It is integrated with collision-free and decoupled multi-robot path planning. An SHP diffuses (i.e., moves points along segments) the points of sharp turns in the global path of the map into nodes, which are used to generate smooth hypocycloidal curves that maintain a safe clearance in relation to the obstacles. These nodes are also used as safe points of retreat to avoid collision with other robots. The novel contributions of this work are as follows: (1) The proposed work is the first use of hypocycloid geometry to produce smooth and continuous paths for robot motion. A mathematical analysis of SHP generation in various scenarios is discussed. (2) The proposed work is also the first to consider the case of smooth and collision-free path generation for a load carrying robot. (3) Traditionally, path smoothing and collision avoidance have been addressed as separate problems. This work proposes integrated and decoupled collision-free multi-robot path planning. 'Node caching' is proposed to improve efficiency. A decoupled approach with local communication enables the paths of robots to be dynamically changed. (4) A novel 'multi-robot map update' in case of dynamic obstacles in the map is proposed, such that robots update other robots about the positions of dynamic obstacles in the map. A timestamp feature ensures that all the robots have the most updated map. Comparison between SHP and other path smoothing techniques and experimental results in real environments confirm that SHP can generate smooth paths for robots and avoid collision with other robots through local communication. {\textcopyright} 2016 Author(s).},

abstract = {The accuracy of robot manipulator, one of the long-standing problem, is a major issue in the industry community. The manipulator may produce kinematic errors during operation. Traditional methods require expensive equipment with complex steps to calibrate kinematic parameters. Another issue is motion planning of the manipulator, which requires a map of the workspace. However, the mapping is time-consuming. In order to employ an efficient way to accomplish kinematic calibration and offer convenience to plan the motions of the manipulator, we study a new method called SKCLAM (Simultaneous Kinematic Calibration, Localization, and Mapping), which can calibrate the kinematic parameters of an industrial manipulator and achieve 3D environmental mapping simultaneously by employing an RGB-D camera attached to the end effector. In this paper, the true kinematic parameters were changed randomly to test and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in simulation.},

By just looking at the scene they can decide which places or objects they can easily reach and which are difficult to approach. Possessing a similar abstraction of a robot arm's capabilities in its workspace is important for grasp planners, path planners and task planners. In this paper, we show that robot arm capabilities manifest themselves as directional structures specific to workspace regions. We introduce a representation scheme that enables to visualize and inspect the directional structures. The directional structures are then captured in the form of a map, which we name the capability map. Using this capability map, a manipulator is able to deduce places that are easy to reach. Furthermore, a manipulator can either transport an object to a place where versatile manipulation is possible or a mobile manipulator or humanoid torso can position itself to enable optimal manipulation of an object.},

abstract = {Mobile manipulation problems involving many objects are challenging to solve due to the high dimensionality and multi-modality of their hybrid configuration spaces. Planners that perform a purely geometric search are prohibitively slow for solving these problems because they are unable to factor the configuration space. Symbolic task planners can efficiently construct plans involving many variables but cannot represent the geometric and kinematic constraints required in manipulation. We present the FFRob algorithm for solving task and motion planning problems. First, we introduce extended action specification (EAS) as a general purpose planning representation that supports arbitrary predicates as conditions. We adapt existing heuristic search ideas for solving strips planning problems, particularly delete-relaxations, to solve EAS problem instances. We then apply the EAS representation and planners to manipulation problems resulting in FFRob. FFRob iteratively discretizes task and motion planning problems using batch sampling of manipulation primitives and a multi-query roadmap structure that can be conditionalized to evaluate reachability under different placements of movable objects. This structure enables the EAS planner to efficiently compute heuristics that incorporate geometric and kinematic planning constraints to give a tight estimate of the distance to the goal. Additionally, we show FFRob is probabilistically complete and has a finite expected runtime. Finally, we empirically demonstrate FFRob's effectiveness on complex and diverse task and motion planning tasks including rearrangement planning and navigation among movable objects.},

abstract = {Robot Motion Planning (RMP) has been a thrust area of research in computing due to its complexity, since RMP in dynamic environments for a point robot with bounded velocity is an NP-hard problem. This paper is a critical review of the major contributions to RMP in dynamic environments. Between 1985 and 2015 the focus has changed from the classical approach to a heuristic approach. For velocity based motion planning in dynamic environments, ICS — AVOID (Fraichard and Asama, 2004, also see Section 2.4.4) is the safest approach which means that this method have the capability of for an autonomous robotic system to avoid collision with the obstacles in the environment. Other important approaches include artificial potential field based, artificial intelligence based, probabilistic based RMP and applications in areas of Agent systems and computer geometry. Classification of the RMP literature on the basis of the techniques and their performance has been attempted.},

annote = {Uses 7DOF robot manipulator. The paper present a search-based planning as an oppose to sampling-based motion planning. They use examples of motion planning in lower dimensionality problem or problems in low-dimensional manifold as a heuristic for motion planning in higher dimensional manifold. From this heuristic, they define motion primitives, a predefine motions of a single joint, and used them to minimize the cost function so that the most optimal path can be realized. This method eliminated the multiple solution to start-to-goal configuration by selecting the most feasible path that avoids collision which may not have the shortest path. They coined their searching-based planner as ARA*. ARA* is different from A* algorithm because A* always aims at getting into a goal configuration at the shortest travesal. ARA* is different in the sense because initially, the selection of path is based on the feasibility of getting into the goal configuration without any collision.

They use occupancy grid map to decrease the intractability of their algorithm so that the ARA motion planner produce the most optimum solution in path planning. They manage the uncertainty of multiple path solution by eliminating it using cost function as constraint to their path planning algorithm.

Validation: they validate their approach by simulating manipulation in a cluttered tabletop and conclude that their approach are only optimal for three degree of freedom pose (translational) rather than a ful six degree of freedom pose (translational in x,y, and z directions together with orientation about the x, y and z lines)
They also perform the same experimentation on a PR2 robot with 7DOF manipulator},

TAMP combines symbolic and geometric reasoning to produce sequential manipulation plans, typically specified as joint-space trajectories, which are valid only as long as the environment is static and perception and control are highly accurate. In case of any changes in the environment, slow re-planning is required. We propose a TAMP algorithm that optimizes over Cartesian frames defined relative to target objects. The resulting plan then remains valid even if the objects are moving and can be executed by reactive controllers that adapt to these changes in real time. We apply our TAMP framework to a torque-controlled robot in a pick and place setting and demonstrate its ability to adapt to changing environments, inaccurate perception, and imprecise control, both in simulation and the real world.},

At the core of our approach are (i) A sequential convex optimization procedure, which penalizes collisions with a hinge loss and increases the penalty coefficients in an outer loop as necessary. (ii) An efficient formulation of the no-collisions constraint that directly considers continuous-time safety and enables the algorithm to reliably solve motion planning problems, including problems involving thin and complex obstacles. We benchmarked our algorithm against several other mo- tion planning algorithms, solving a suite of 7-degree-of-freedom (DOF) arm-planning problems and 18-DOF full-body planning problems. We compared against sampling-based planners from OMPL, and we also compared to CHOMP, a leading approach for trajectory optimization. Our algorithm was faster than the alternatives, solved more problems, and yielded higher quality paths. Experimental evaluation on the following additional problem types also confirmed the speed and effectiveness of our approach: (i) Planning foot placements with 34 degrees of freedom (28 joints + 6 DOF pose) of the Atlas humanoid robot as it maintains static stability and has to negotiate environmental constraints. (ii) Industrial box picking. (iii) Real-world motion planning for the PR2 that requires considering all degrees of freedom at the same time.},

@article{Koval2013,
abstract = {We investigate the problem of using contact sensors to estimate the pose of an object during planar pushing by a fixed-shape hand. Contact sensors are unique because they inherently discriminate between "contact" and "no-contact" configurations. As a result, the set of object configurations that activates a sensor constitutes a lower-dimensional contact manifold in the configuration space of the object. This causes conventional state estimation methods, such as the particle filter, to perform poorly during periods of contact due to particle starvation. In this paper, we introduce the manifold particle filter as a principled way of solving the state estimation problem when the state moves between multiple manifolds of different dimensionality. The manifold particle filter avoids particle starvation during contact by adaptively sampling particles that reside on the contact manifold from the dual proposal distribution. We describe three techniques, one analytical and two sample-based, of sampling from the dual proposal distribution and compare their relative strengths and weaknesses. We present simulation results that show that all three techniques outperform the conventional particle filter in both speed and accuracy. In addition, we implement the manifold particle filter on a real robot and show that it successfully tracks the pose of a pushed object using commercially available tactile sensors.},
annote = {The author present a situation where constant contact and manipulation of an object, by pushing the object, can be used to estimate the state of the object; i. e. the position and the orientation of the object. They term the process as contact manipulation. 

They argue that with the absence of more conventional observation from sensors such as a laser range finder and a vision camera, tactile based sensor can perform state estimation using appropriate filtering technique. Since tactile sensor has non-gaussian characteristic and highly nonlinear, the authors used particle filter as their estimator. 

The use of tactile sensor, however, introduce uncertainty because the sensor has low spatial resolution or low manifold. This is regarded as a low-dimensional manifold problem where the state estimation has higher dimensionality (two for position on a plane and one for orientation). Although intuitively increasing the resolution of the tactile sensor may decrease the spatial uncertainty, it is not the case for tactile sensing with particle filtering technique. Thus, the authors introduce manifold particle filter. (MPF).

An MPF reduce the dimensionality of the state estimation by marginalizing the probability distribution of the state of the object based on the observation from the tactile sensing and use it as a prior estimate.

To implement the MPF, the state estimation follows three steps:
(a) assumption of the state of the object by evenly weighting particles
(b) action which involve pushing the object
(c) observation where the MPF use the pressure profile during pushing to estimate the state of the object.

They implement the algorithm using OpenRAVE simulation environment and evaluate it with a simulated BarrettHand. They then run an experiment using Andy, a robot module developed for Darpa ARM-S competition. They compared their result with a conventional particle filter (CPF) and imporved estimation of the object state.},

@article{Chin2016,
abstract = {More than a million insects and approximately 11,000 vertebrates utilize flapping wings to fly. However, flapping flight has only been studied in a few of these species, so many challenges remain in understanding this form of locomotion. Five key aerodynamic mechanisms have been identified for insect flight. Among these is the leading edge vortex, which is a convergent solution to avoid stall for insects, bats and birds. The roles of the other mechanisms - added mass, clap and fling, rotational circulation and wing-wake interactions - have not yet been thoroughly studied in the context of vertebrate flight. Further challenges to understanding bat and bird flight are posed by the complex, dynamic wing morphologies of these species and the more turbulent airflow generated by their wings compared with that observed during insect flight. Nevertheless, three dimensionless numbers that combine key flow, morphological and kinematic parameters - the Reynolds number, Rossby number and advance ratio - govern flapping wing aerodynamics for both insects and vertebrates. These numbers can thus be used to organize an integrative framework for studying and comparing animal flapping flight. Here, we provide a roadmap for developing such a framework, highlighting the aerodynamic mechanisms that remain to be quantified and compared across species. Ultimately, incorporating complex flight maneuvers, environmental effects and developmental stages into this framework will also be essential to advancing our understanding of the biomechanics, movement ecology and evolution of animal flight.},

The system is equipped with uniform software architecture able to control the motion of both components. Some exteroceptive sensors like sonars and laser rangefinders are available on the mobile platform, some others are mounted on the end-effector of the manipulator: a colour camera, able to locate objects to operate with; an ultrasound range finder, near the camera, that will be used to get distance measures. In this paper we consider the problem of relocalising the mobile manipulator in a known environment supposing that no base movement is allowed to avoid hazard operations. As only the arm can be safely panned to explore the surroundings, the proposed procedure is based exclusively on the ultrasound rangefinder. Using such measures, and making the hypothesis that the arm configuration in known, a Monte Carlo filter is designed to estimate the base pose. Such multiple hypotheses filter is appropriate in this kind of problems where, in the best case, it is possible to retrieve a finite number of possible poses compatible with available measures},

abstract = {Generally, information is the fundamental driver of assets pricing volatility in the financial market. This information can enter into the market either symmetrically or asymmetrically. The financial literature shows that Bitcoin market volatility is symmetrically informative and has a long memory to persist in the future. Additionally, the symmetricity of volatility has been revealed to be of greater sensitivity to its past values compared to the new shock of the market values. This study therefore applied the symmetric volatility structure of Bitcoin currency which can be measured through four input attributes such as open price (OP), high price (HP), low price (LP), and close price (CP) for predicting its price future trend. The study uses Rapid-Miner programme based on artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. The optimal model employs a multilayer neural network (NN) along with an “optimised operator” with the ability to locate the optimal factor loading of the applied algorithm. The findings indicate that ANN is an effective and adequate model for correctly predicting Bitcoin market prices using symmetric volatility attributes with accuracy level of 92.15% against the actual price, whereas the low price attribute is found to be the major promoter for Bitcoin price trend with percentage of 63%. This is followed by close price, high price, and open price with percentages of 49%, 46%, and 37%, respectively. The findings of the study therefore would be a valuable and significant input for commercial purposes among the cryptocurrency market players. In other worlds, based on these outcomes investors will proactively predicate the Bitcoin price trend and make the right investment decision either to buy, hold, or sale to gain up normal market return. This is considered a pioneering study that predicates the Bitcoin price trend based on its symmetric volatility structure. As these replication findings demonstrate, the proposed model is highly promising and applicable in a real-time trading system for predicting Bitcoin price future trend and maximising investment profits in Cryptocurrency markets.},

abstract = {We investigate the kinematic feasibility of a tendon-based flexible parallel platform actuator. Much of the research on tendon-driven Stewart platforms is devoted either to the completely restrained positioning mechanism (CRPM) or to one particular type of the incompletely restrained positioning mechanism (IRPM) where the external force is provided by the gravitational pull on the platform such as in cable-suspended Stewart platforms. An IRPM-based platform is proposed which uses the external force provided by a compliant member. The compliant central column allows the configuration to achieve n DOFs with n tendons. In particular, this investigation focuses on the angular deflection of the upper platform with respect to the lower platform. The application here is aimed at developing a linkable module that can be connected to one another so as to form a "snake robot" of sorts. Since locomotion takes precedence over positioning in this application, a 3-DOF Stewart platform is adopted. For an arbitrary angular displace of the end-effector, the corresponding length of each tendon can be determined through inverse kinematics. Mathematical singularities are investigated using the traditional analytical method of defining the Jacobian. &copy; 2015 Md. Masum Billah and Raisuddin Khan.},

@phdthesis{Endres2015,
abstract = {ABSTRACT In recent years, commercially available mobile robots, that operate in indoor environments, have found their ways into private homes, office environments, and industrial settings. They fulfill important duties such as transportation, telepresence, and cleaning. While some tasks, such as vacuum cleaning, can be achieved with rudimentary perception, for more complex tasks sophisticated perception capabilities are fundamental for autonomous robots. Even for the mentioned vacuum cleaning, improved perception allows for substantial increases in efficiency. In this thesis, we investigate novel approaches for the modelling of indoor environments for robot navigation. Being an important foundation for higher level skills, a particular focus lies on simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), which allows a robot to construct a model of its environment during operation. In the context of SLAM, we develop an approach for RGB-D cameras, that captures dense 3D maps for robot navigation. For this SLAM system, we propose novel methods to increase the accuracy of the trajectory estimation and the robustness against misassociations during individual motion estimates. Further, we address a major limitation on the hardware side of RGB-D cameras, namely the limited field of view. We investigate SLAM with multiple RGB-D cameras and develop an approach for automated extrinsic calibration of RGB-D cameras via SLAM. We further propose an extension of RGB-D sensors with mirrors to bisect the field of view into two roughly opposite views. While this does not increase the overall information perceived, we show that the divided field of view is beneficial in the context of SLAM. Additionally, we exploit the structural properties of this catadioptric extension to constrain the mentioned calibration method, such that planar motion of the robot is sufficient for online calibration of the two views. To autonomously access all areas in a private home or office, a further key skill for robot navigation is the operation of doors. In this context, we extend the state of the art by novel methods for learning a model of the kinematics and dynamics of a door. We demonstrate that the knowledge about the dynamics of a door allows the robot to accurately predict the motion of the door from inertia. We use this ability to employ a door opening strategy with low requirements on the dexterous workspace of the manipulator. To show the benefits of the approaches proposed in this thesis, we thoroughly evaluate them in experiments with real robots and real sensor data. Overall, the proposed approaches lower the cost of the sensing equipment and the required complexity of the manipulator. These factors are particular important for commercial robots targeted at households and small businesses.},

abstract = {Metal citrate gels of samarium and magnesium were used as precursors for the generation of hollow sphere particles by spray pyrolysis under mild thermal conditions. Six mixtures with different Sm/Mg ratios as well as pure Sm and Mg samples were prepared. As a result of the low synthesis temperature the particles consist of amorphous metal carboxylate networks. The texture of the shells is governed by microporosity yielding the major part of the total surface area. A detailed investigation of thermal decomposition, crystallization, and grain growth behavior was carried out under constant heating rate conditions. The decomposition products are nanocrystalline Sm2O3 and MgO and corresponding two-phase nanocomposites. The pure samarium carboxylate gel features considerably higher thermal stability compared with the one comprised of only magnesium. Accordingly the decomposition behavior of mixed samples is dependent on the Sm/Mg ratio. Furthermore it is shown that small amounts of MgO are able to slow down the kinetics of grain growth of Sm2O3 whereas high amounts are necessary to significantly reduce the final grain size at 1000 degrees C.},

Current action recognition databases contain on the order of ten different action categories collected under fairly controlled conditions. State-of-the-art performance on these datasets is now near ceiling and thus there is a need for the design and creation of new benchmarks. To address this issue we collected the largest action video database to-date with 51 action categories, which in total contain around 7,000 manually annotated clips extracted from a variety of sources ranging from digitized movies to YouTube. We use this database to evaluate the performance of two representative computer vision systems for action recognition and explore the robustness of these methods under various conditions such as camera motion, viewpoint, video quality and occlusion.},

The visual feedback from the camera is use with their control strategy. The extended Kalman filter is use to predict the relative position of the object while it is moving.

Since the researcher maintain a constant velocity to the object, the tracking can use a Kalman filtering technique without linearization. However, since the tracking of the object requires the movement of the camera, given the nonlinearity of an inverse kinematic solution of their robot system, the use of extended Kalman filter is justified.

@article{Henningsson2014,
abstract = {Many flying animals use both flapping and gliding flight as part of their routine behaviour. These two kinematic patterns impose conflicting requirements on wing design for aerodynamic efficiency and, in the absence of extreme morphing, wings cannot be optimised for both flight modes. In gliding flight, the wing experiences uniform incident flow and the optimal shape is a high aspect ratio wing with an elliptical planform. In flapping flight, on the other hand, the wing tip travels faster than the root, creating a spanwise velocity gradient. To compensate, the optimal wing shape should taper towards the tip (reducing the local chord) and/or twist from root to tip (reducing local angle of attack). We hypothesised that, if a bird is limited in its ability to morph its wings and adapt its wing shape to suit both flight modes, then a preference towards flapping flight optimization will be expected since this is the most energetically demanding flight mode. We tested this by studying a well-known flap-gliding species, the common swift, by measuring the wakes generated by two birds, one in gliding and one in flapping flight in a wind tunnel. We calculated span efficiency, the efficiency of lift production, and found that the flapping swift had consistently higher span efficiency than the gliding swift. This supports our hypothesis and suggests that even though swifts have been shown previously to increase their lift-to-drag ratio substantially when gliding, the wing morphology is tuned to be more aerodynamically efficient in generating lift during flapping. Since body drag can be assumed to be similar for both flapping and gliding, it follows that the higher total drag in flapping flight compared with gliding flight is primarily a consequence of an increase in wing profile drag due to the flapping motion, exceeding the reduction in induced drag.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for robot motion planning in dynamic environments. It consists of selecting avoidance maneuvers to avoid static and moving obstacles in the velocity space, based on the current positions and velocities of the robot and obstacles. It is a first-order method, since it does not integrate velocities to yield positions as functions of time. The avoidance maneuvers are generated by selecting robot velocities outside of the velocity obstacles, which represent the set of robot velocities that would result in a collision with a given obstacle that moves at a given velocity, at some future time. To ensure that the avoidance maneuver is dynamically feasible, the set of avoidance velocities is intersected with the set of admissible velocities, defined by the robot's acceleration constraints. Computing new avoidance maneuvers at regular time intervals accounts for general obstacle trajectories. The trajectory from start to goal is computed by searching a tree of feasible avoidance maneuvers, computed at discrete time intervals. An exhaustive search of the tree yields near-optimal trajectories that either minimize distance or motion time. A heuristic search of the tree is applicable to on-line planning. The method is demonstrated for point and disk robots among static and moving obstacles, and for an automated vehicle in an intelligent vehicle highway system scenario.},

abstract = {Real-time dense 3D localization and mapping systems are required to enable robotics platforms to interact in and with their environments. Several solutions have used surfel representations to model the world. While they produce impressive results, they require heavy and costly hardware to operate properly. Many of them are also limited to static environments and small inter-frame motions. Whereas most of the state of the art approaches focus on the accuracy of the reconstruction, we assume that many robotics applications do not require a high resolution level in the rebuilt surface and can benefit from a less accurate but less expensive map, so as to gain in run-time and memory efficiency. In this paper we propose a fast RGB-D SLAM articulated around a rough and lightweight 3D representation for dense compact mapping in dynamic indoor environment, targeting mainstream computing platforms. A simple and fast formulation to detect and filter out dynamic elements is also presented. We show the robustness of our system, its low memory requirement and the good performance it enables.},

abstract = {In this article, we present an approach for the fusion of 2d and 3d measurements for model-based person tracking, also known as Human Motion Capture. The applied body model is defined geometrically with generalized cylinders, and is set up hierarchically with connecting joints of different types. The joint model can be parameterized to control the degrees of freedom, adhesion and stiffness. This results in an articulated body model with constrained kinematic degrees of freedom. The fusion approach incorporates this model knowledge together with the measurements, and tracks the target body iteratively with an extended Iterative Closest Point (ICP) approach. Generally, the ICP is based on the concept of correspondences between measurements and model, which is normally exploited to incorporate 3d point cloud measurements. The concept has been generalized to represent and incorporate also 2d image space features. Together with the 3D point cloud from a 3d time-of-flight (ToF) camera, arbitrary features, derived from 2D camera images, are used in the fusion algorithm for tracking of the body. This gives complementary information about the tracked body, enabling not only tracking of depth motions but also turning movements of the human body, which is normally a hard problem for markerless human motion capture systems. The resulting tracking system, named VooDoo is used to track humans in a Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) context. We only rely on sensors on board the robot, i.e. the color camera, the ToF camera and a laser range finder. The system runs in realtime (∼20 Hz) and is able to robustly track a human in the vicinity of the robot. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

As part of their construction,\nRF predictors naturally lead to a dissimilarity measure\nbetween the observations. One can also define an RF\ndissimilarity measure between unlabeled data: the idea is\nto construct an RF predictor that distinguishes the\nobserved data from suitably generated synthetic data. The\nobserved data are the original unlabeled data and the\nsynthetic data are drawn from a reference distribution.\nHere we describe the properties of the RF dissimilarity and\nmake recommendations on how to use it in practice. An RF\ndissimilarity can be attractive because it handles mixed\nvariable types well, is invariant to monotonic\ntransformations of the input variables, and is robust to\noutlying observations. The RF dissimilarity easily deals\nwith a large number of variables due to its intrinsic\nvariable selection; for example, the Addcl 1 RF\ndissimilarity weighs the contribution of each variable\naccording to how dependent it is on other variables. We\nfind that the RF dissimilarity is useful for detecting\ntumor sample clusters on the basis of tumor marker\nexpressions.

abstract = {Despite much research progress in image semantic segmentation, it remains challenging under adverse environmental conditions caused by imaging limitations of visible spectrum. While thermal infrared cameras have several advantages over cameras for the visible spectrum, such as operating in total darkness, insensitive to illumination variations, robust to shadow effects and strong ability to penetrate haze and smog. These advantages of thermal infrared cameras make the segmentation of semantic objects in day and night. In this paper, we propose a novel network architecture, called edge-conditioned convolutional neural network (EC-CNN), for thermal image semantic segmentation. Particularly, we elaborately design a gated feature-wise transform layer in EC-CNN to adaptively incorporate edge prior knowledge. The whole EC-CNN is end-to-end trained, and can generate high-quality segmentation results with the edge guidance. Meanwhile, we also introduce a new benchmark dataset named "Segment Objects in Day And night"(SODA) for comprehensive evaluations in thermal image semantic segmentation. SODA contains over 7,168 manually annotated and synthetically generated thermal images with 20 semantic region labels and from a broad range of viewpoints and scene complexities. Extensive experiments on SODA demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EC-CNN against the state-of-the-art methods.},

Anytime planners are well suited for these problems: they find a feasible solution quickly and then continually work on improving it until time runs out. In this paper we propose an anytime heuristic search, ARA*, which tunes its performance bound based on available search time. It starts by finding a suboptimal solution quickly using a loose bound, then tightens the bound progressively as time allows. Given enough time it finds a provably optimal solution. While improving its bound, ARA* reuses previous search efforts and, as a result, is significantly more efficient than other anytime search methods. In addition to our theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the practical utility of ARA* with experiments on a simulated robot kinematic arm and a dynamic path planning problem for an outdoor rover.},

annote = {This paper address nonlinearity problem of an elastic cable as power transmission between a motor and a joint for a surgical arm. The coupling between the motor and the robot joint reduce armature mass, inertia and size for expert surgery. However, the cable elasticity introduces uncertainty and nonlinearity to the kinematics and the dynamics of the surgical arm. 

The authors introduce an estimation method that uses a standard unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and a square root Kalman filter (srUKF) to estimate cable coupling parameter and the position of the end effector (end point) in real-time.

The authors implement their method using the Raven-II, a seven degree of freedom serial manipulator, as their surgical arm. The surgical arm is equip with an optical encoder attached to the motors and position sensor on each joint for data validation. In their research, the authors only address the first three joint for state estimation of the Raven-II.

They model the armature dynamics using forward and inverse dynamis with Newton-Euler equations . Their inverse dynamic solution is based on the recursive Newton-Euler algorithm.

The Newton-Euler equations requires model parameters. The authors identify the initial inertial matrices, mass and the center of mass of the system using a computer aided design model. 
The authors use srUKF to estimate the joint angle and joint position of the surgical arm online. Also, the authors use the standard UKF to estimate the coupling parameter offline. They compute spring constant, damping constant, coulomb and viscous friction of the motor side and the joint side experimentally (empirically) translate into a table?

They validate their method experimentally using three different design. The first two experiments involve changing the cable tension and the third experiment involve picking an object of the mass 100 g under high cable tension. They compared the reuslt of the three experiment between the dynamic model that uses their UKF estimation and the dynamic model that has no filtering technique. They improved the accuracy of the joints position to 1.433, 36.76, and 62.99for joints 1, 2 and 3 respectively},

First the novel concept of state-time space is introduced, i.e. the state space of the robot augmented ofthe time dimension. Like configuration space which is a tool to formulate path-planning problems, state-time space is a tool to formulate trajectory planning in dynamic workspace problems. It permits us to study the different aspects of dynamic trajectory planning, i.e. moving obstacles anddynamic constraints, in a unified way. Then this new concept is applied to the case of a car-like robot subject to dynamic constraints and moving along a given path on a dynamic planar workspace. A near-time-optimal approach that searches the solution trajectory over a restricted set of canonicaltrajectories is presented. These canonical trajectories are defined as having discrete and piecewise constant acceleration. Under these assumptions, it is possible to transform the problem of finding the time-optimal canonical trajectory to finding the shortest path in a directed graph embeddedin the state-time space. {\textcopyright} 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

In a previous study, it was shown that Theodorsen's and Wagner's unsteady aerodynamic models agree with force data from DNS for pitching and plunging maneuvers of a 2D at plate at Reynolds numbers between 100 and 300 as long as the reduced frequency k is not too large, k < 2, and the e ective angle-of-attack is below the critical angle. In this study reduced order models are obtained using an improved method, the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), which is more ecient to compute and ts within a standard control design framework. For test cases involving pitching and plunging motions, it is shown that Wagner's indicial response is closely approximated by ERA models of orders 4 and 6, respectively. All models are tested in a framework that decouples the longitudinal ight dynamic and aerodynamic models, so that the aerodynamics are viewed as an input-output system between wing kinematics and the forces generated. Lagrangian coherent structures are used to visualize the unsteady separated ow.},

abstract = {Most professional programmers that I've encountered are not well prepared to tackle algorithm design problems. This is a pity, because the techniques of algorithm design form one of the core practical technologies of computer science. Designing correct, efficient, and implementable algorithms for real-world problems requires access to two distinct bodies of knowledge: * Techniques - Good algorithm designers understand several fundamental algorithm design techniques, including data structures, dynamic programming, depth first search, backtracking, and heuristics. Perhaps the single most important design technique is modeling, the art of abstracting a messy real-world application into a clean problem suitable for algorithmic attack. * Resources - Good algorithm designers stand on the shoulders of giants. Rather than laboring from scratch to produce a new algorithm for every task, they can figure out what is known about a particular problem. Rather than re-implementing popular algorithms from scratch, they seek existing implementations to serve as a starting point. They are familiar with many classic algorithmic problems, which provide sufficient source material to model most any application. This book is intended as a manual on algorithm design, providing access to combinatorial algorithm technology for both students and computer professionals.},

abstract = {Robots operating in domestic environments generally need to interact with articulated objects, such as doors, cabinets, dishwashers or fridges. In this work, we present a novel, probabilistic framework for modeling articulated objects as kinematic graphs. Vertices in this graph correspond to object parts, while edges between them model their kinematic relationship. In particular, we present a set of parametric and non-parametric edge models and how they can robustly be estimated from noisy pose observations. We furthermore describe how to estimate the kinematic structure and how to use the learned kinematic models for pose prediction and for robotic manipulation tasks. We finally present how the learned models can be generalized to new and previously unseen objects. In various experiments using real robots with different camera systems as well as in simulation, we show that our approach is valid, accurate and efficient. Further, we demonstrate that our approach has a broad set of applications, in particular for the emerging fields of mobile manipulation and service robotics.},

Sintering studies were performed at temperatures between 1200 degrees-1300 degrees C for 10-960 min to obtain densities from 60-100% theoretical density. The grain size was measured by the linear intercept method as a function of density. Sintering paths of nanocrystalline yttria were obtained; and. are discussed in comparison to microcrystalline yttria. Rapid coarsening at low temperatures and densities occurs in nanocrystalline yttria. Also differential sintering is observed. At later stages coarsening and densification occur simultaneously.

abstract = {Vision-aided inertial navigation systems (V-INSs) can provide precise state estimates for the 3-D motion of a vehicle when no external references (e.g., GPS) are available. This is achieved by combining inertial measurements from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) with visual observations from a camera under the assumption that the rigid transformation between the two sensors is known. Errors in the IMU-camera extrinsic calibration process cause biases that reduce the estimation accuracy and can even lead to divergence of any estimator processing the measurements from both sensors. In this paper, we present an extended Kalman filter for precisely determining the unknown transformation between a camera and an IMU. Contrary to previous approaches, we explicitly account for the time correlation of the IMU measurements and provide a figure of merit (covariance) for the estimated transformation. The proposed method does not require any special hardware (such as spin table or 3-D laser scanner) except a calibration target. Furthermore, we employ the observability rank criterion based on Lie derivatives and prove that the nonlinear system describing the IMU-camera calibration process is observable. Simulation and experimental results are presented that validate the proposed method and quantify its accuracy.},

The use of multimodal sensors for human action recognition is steadily increasing. However, there are limited publicly available datasets where depth camera and inertial sensor data are captured at the same time. This paper describes a freely available dataset, named UTD-MHAD, which consists of four temporally synchro-nized data modalities. These modalities include RGB videos, depth videos, skeleton positions, and inertial signals from a Kinect cam-era and a wearable inertial sensor for a comprehensive set of 27 human actions. Experimental results are provided to show how this database can be used to study fusion approaches that involve using both depth camera data and inertial sensor data. This public do-main dataset is of benefit to multimodality research activities being conducted for human action recognition by various research groups.},

This paper proposes a novel Spline-based Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (SRRT) algorithm which treats both the external and internal constraints simultaneously and efficiently. The computationally expensive numerical integration of the system dynamics is replaced by an efficient spline curve parameterization. In addition, the SRRT guarantees continuity of curvature along the path satisfying any upper-bounded curvature constraints. This paper presents the underlying theory to the SRRT algorithm and presents simulation and experiment results of a mobile robot efficiently navigating through cluttered environments.},

abstract = {Pose estimation is central to several robotics applications such as registration, hand-eye calibration, SLAM, etc. Online pose estimation methods typically use Gaussian distributions to describe the uncertainty in the pose parameters. Such a description can be inadequate when using parameters such as unit-quaternions that are not unimodally distributed. A Bingham distribution can effectively model the uncertainty in unit-quaternions, as it has antipodal symmetry and is defined on a unit-hypersphere. A combination of Gaussian and Bingham distributions is used to develop a linear filter that accurately estimates the distribution of the pose parameters, in their true space. To the best of our knowledge our approach is the first implementation to use a Bingham distribution for 6 DoF pose estimation. Experiments assert that this approach is robust to initial estimation errors as well as sensor noise. Compared to state of the art methods, our approach takes fewer iterations to converge onto the correct pose estimate. The efficacy of the formulation is illustrated with a number of simulated examples on standard datasets as well as real-world experiments.},

abstract = {Point cloud registration is a key problem for computer vision applied to robotics, medical imaging, and other applications. This problem involves finding a rigid transformation from one point cloud into another so that they align. Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and its variants provide simple and easily-implemented iterative methods for this task, but these algorithms can converge to spurious local optima. To address local optima and other difficulties in the ICP pipeline, we propose a learning-based method, titled Deep Closest Point (DCP), inspired by recent techniques in computer vision and natural language processing. Our model consists of three parts: a point cloud embedding network, an attention-based module combined with a pointer generation layer, to approximate combinatorial matching, and a differentiable singular value decomposition (SVD) layer to extract the final rigid transformation. We train our model end-to-end on the ModelNet40 dataset and show in several settings that it performs better than ICP, its variants (e.g., Go-ICP, FGR), and the recently-proposed learning-based method PointNetLK. Beyond providing a state-of-the-art registration technique, we evaluate the suitability of our learned features transferred to unseen objects. We also provide preliminary analysis of our learned model to help understand whether domain-specific and/or global features facilitate rigid registration.},

abstract = {Current 3D object detection methods are heavily influenced by 2D detectors. In order to leverage architectures in 2D detectors, they often convert 3D point clouds to regular grids (i.e., to voxel grids or to bird's eye view images), or rely on detection in 2D images to propose 3D boxes. Few works have attempted to directly detect objects in point clouds. In this work, we return to first principles to construct a 3D detection pipeline for point cloud data and as generic as possible. However, due to the sparse nature of the data -- samples from 2D manifolds in 3D space -- we face a major challenge when directly predicting bounding box parameters from scene points: a 3D object centroid can be far from any surface point thus hard to regress accurately in one step. To address the challenge, we propose VoteNet, an end-to-end 3D object detection network based on a synergy of deep point set networks and Hough voting. Our model achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection on two large datasets of real 3D scans, ScanNet and SUN RGB-D with a simple design, compact model size and high efficiency. Remarkably, VoteNet outperforms previous methods by using purely geometric information without relying on color images.},

abstract = {This paper utilizes a human-robot interface system which incorporates particle filter (PF) and adaptive multispace transformation (AMT) to track the pose of the human hand for controlling the robot manipulator. This system employs a 3D camera (Kinect) to determine the orientation and the translation of the human hand. We use Camshift algorithm to track the hand. PF is used to estimate the translation of the human hand. Although a PF is used for estimating the translation, the translation error increases in a short period of time when the sensors fail to detect the hand motion. Therefore, a methodology to correct the translation error is required. What is more, to be subject to the perceptive limitations and the motor limitations, human operator is hard to carry out the high precision operation. This paper proposes an adaptive multispace transformation (AMT) method to assist the operator to improve the accuracy and reliability in determining the pose of the robot. The human-robot interface system was experimentally tested in a lab environment, and the results indicate that such a system can successfully control a robot manipulator.},

A new Bayesian statisti- cal foundation for the operations promises further improvement MRL proposes to build a software framework running on processors onboard the new Uranus mobile robot that will maintain a proba- bilistic, geometric map of the robot's sur- roundings as it moves, The certainty grid representation will allow this map to be incrementally updated in a uniform way based on information coming from vari- ous sources, including sonar, stereo vision, proximity, and contact sensors The approach can correctly model the fuzzi- ness of each reading and, at the same time, combine multiple measurements to produce sharper map features; it can also deal correctly with uncertainties in the robot's motion The map will be used by planning programs to choose clear paths, identify locations (by correlating maps), identify well-known and insufficiently sensed terrain, and perhaps identify objects by shape. The certainty grid repre- sentation can be extended in the time dimension and used to detect and track moving objects Even the simplest ver- sions of the idea allow us to fairly straightforwardly program the robot for tasks that have hitherto been out of reach MRL looks forward to a program that can explore a region and return to its starting place, using map “snapshots” from its out- bound journey to find its way back, even in the presence of disturbances of its motion and occasional changes in the terrain.},

@article{Zhang2015,
abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to develop a wearable-based human-manipulator interface which integrates the interval Kalman filter (IKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), over damping method (ODM) and adaptive multispace transformation (AMT) to perform immersive human-manipulator interaction by interacting the natural and continuous motion of the human operators hand with the robot manipulator. Design/methodology/approach The interface requires that a wearable watch is tightly worn on the operators hand to track the continuous movements of the operators hand. Nevertheless, the measurement errors generated by the sensor error and tracking failure signicantly occur several times, which means that the measurement is not determined with sufficient accuracy. Due to this fact, IKF and UKF are used to compensate for the noisy and incomplete measurements, and ODM is established to eliminate the influence of the error signals like data jitter. Furthermore, to be subject to the inherent perceptive limitations of the human operator and the motor, AMT that focuses on a secondary treatment is also introduced. Findings Experimental studies on the GOOGOL GRB3016 robot show that such a wearable-based interface that incorporates the feedback mechanism and hybrid filters can operate the robot manipulator more flexibly and advantageously even if the operator is nonprofessional; the feedback mechanism introduced here can successfully assist in improving the performance of the interface. Originality/value The interface uses one wearable watch to simultaneously track the orientation and position of the operators hand; it is not only avoids problems of occlusion, identification and limited operating space, but also realizes a kind of two-way human-manipulator interaction, a feedback mechanism can be triggered in the watch to reflect the system states in real time. Furthermore, the interface gets rid of the synchronization question in posture estimation, as hybrid filters work independently to compensate the noisy measurements respectively. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited [ISSN 0143-991X].},

abstract = {In this paper, we deal with the problem of creating globally consistent pose graphs in a centralized multi-robot SLAM framework. For each robot to act autonomously, individual onboard pose estimates and maps are maintained, which are then communicated to a central server to build an optimized global map. However, inconsistencies between onboard and server estimates can occur due to onboard odometry drift or failure. Furthermore, robots do not benefit from the collaborative map if the server provides no feedback in a computationally tractable and bandwidth-efficient manner. Motivated by this challenge, this paper proposes a novel collaborative mapping framework to enable accurate global mapping among robots and server. In particular, structural differences between robot and server graphs are exploited at different spatial scales using graph spectral analysis to generate necessary constraints for the individual robot pose graphs. The proposed approach is thoroughly analyzed and validated using several real-world multi-robot field deployments where we show improvements of the onboard system up to 90%.},

It explicitly represents not only occupied space, but also free and unknown areas. Furthermore, we propose an octree map compression method that keeps the 3D models compact. Our framework is available as an open-source C++ library and has already been successfully applied in several robotics projects. We present a series of experimental results carried out with real robots and on publicly available real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach is able to update the representation efficiently and models the data consistently while keeping the memory requirement at a minimum. ? 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Nevertheless, compensation rises and shifts to performance-insensitive components during fundraising booms. Further, the behavior of distributions around contractual fee triggers is consistent with an underlying agency conflict between investors and fund managers. Our evidence suggests that managers with higher fees deliver higher gross performance, and highlights that agency costs are an inevitable consequence of the information frictions endemic to agency relationships.},

We fuse all of the depth data streamed from a Kinect sensor into a single global implicit surface model of the observed scene in real-time. The current sensor pose is simultaneously obtained by tracking the live depth frame relative to the global model using a coarse-to-fine iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which uses all of the observed depth data available. We demonstrate the advantages of tracking against the growing full surface model compared with frame-to-frame tracking, obtaining tracking and mapping results in constant time within room sized scenes with limited drift and high accuracy. We also show both qualitative and quantitative results relating to various aspects of our tracking and mapping system. Modelling of natural scenes, in real-time with only commodity sensor and GPU hardware, promises an exciting step forward in augmented reality (AR), in particular, it allows dense surfaces to be reconstructed in real-time, with a level of detail and robustness beyond any solution yet presented using passive computer vision.},

In several classes of problems a natural partition arises among variables involved in the estimation. A subset of the variables are actually of interest for the user: we call those target variables. The remaining variables are essential for the formulation of the optimization problem underlying maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation; however these variables, that we call support variables, are not strictly required as output of the estimation problem. In this paper, we propose a systematic way to abstract support variables, defining optimization problems that are only defined over the set of target variables. This abstraction naturally leads to the definition of smart factors, which correspond to constraints among target variables. We show that this perspective unifies the treatment of heterogeneous problems, ranging from structureless bundle adjustment to robust estimation in SLAM. Moreover, it enables to exploit the underlying structure of the optimization problem and the treatment of degenerate instances, enhancing both computational efficiency and robustness.},

abstract = {In this work we address the task of the contextual classification of an airborne LiDAR point cloud. For that purpose, we integrate a Random Forest classifier into a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework. It is a flexible approach for obtaining a reliable classification result even in complex urban scenes. In this way, we benefit from the consideration of context on the one hand and from the opportunity to use a large amount of features on the other hand. Considering the interactions in our experiments increases the overall accuracy by 2%, though a larger improvement becomes apparent in the completeness and correctness of some of the seven classes discerned in our experiments. We compare the Random Forest approach to linear models for the computation of unary and pairwise potentials of the CRF, and investigate the relevance of different features for the LiDAR points as well as for the interaction of neighbouring points. In a second step, building objects are detected based on the classified point cloud. For that purpose, the CRF probabilities for the classes are plugged into a Markov Random Field as unary potentials, in which the pairwise potentials are based on a Potts model. The 2D binary building object masks are extracted and evaluated by the benchmark ISPRS Test Project on Urban Classification and 3D Building Reconstruction. The evaluation shows that the main buildings (larger than 50m2) can be detected very reliably with a correctness larger than 96% and a completeness of 100%. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

These technological interventions allow students to focus on classroom activities rather than on note-taking. To date, students have taken three introductory undergraduate mathematics courses (College Algebra and Trigonometry, Calculus I, and Calculus II) using Tablet PCs.

abstract = {The rapid and accurate assessment of building damage states using only post-event remote sensing data is critical when performing loss estimation in earthquake emergency response. Damaged roof detection is one of the most efficient methods of assessing building damage. In particular, airborne LiDAR is often used to detect roofs damaged by earthquakes, especially for certain damage types, due to its ability to rapidly acquire accurate 3D information on individual roofs. Earthquake-induced roof damages are categorized into surface damages and structural damages based on the geometry features of the debris and the roof structure. However, recent studies have mainly focused on surface damage; little research has been conducted on structural damage. This paper presents an original 3D shape descriptor of individual roofs for detecting roofs with surface damage and roofs exhibiting structural damage by identifying spatial patterns of compact and regular contours for intact roofs, as well as jagged and irregular contours for damaged roofs. The 3D shape descriptor is extracted from building contours derived from airborne LiDAR point clouds. First, contour clusters are extracted from contours that are generated from a dense DSM of individual buildings derived from point clouds. Second, the shape chaos indexes of contour clusters are computed as the information entropy through a contour shape similarity measurement between two contours in a contour cluster. Finally, the 3D shape descriptor is calculated as the weighted sum of the shape chaos index of each contour cluster corresponding to an individual roof. Damaged roofs are detected solely using the 3D shape descriptor with the maximum entropy threshold. Experiments using post-event airborne LiDAR point clouds of the 2010 Haiti earthquake suggest that the proposed damaged roof detection technique using the proposed 3D shape descriptor can detect both roofs exhibiting surface damage and roofs exhibiting structural damage with a high accuracy.},

abstract = {A probabilistic method for tracking 3D articulated human figures in monocular image sequences is presented. Within a Bayesian framework, we define a generative model of image appearance, a robust likelihood function based on image graylevel differences, and a prior probability distribution over pose and joint angles that models how humans move. The posterior probability distribution over model parameters is represented using a discrete set of samples and is propagated over time using particle filtering. The approach extends previous work on parameterized optical flow estimation to exploit a complex 3D articulated motion model. It also extends previous work on human motion tracking by including a perspective camera model, by modeling limb self occlusion, and by recovering 3D motion from a monocular sequence. The explicit posterior probability distribution represents ambiguities due to image matching, model singularities, and perspective projection. The method relies only on a frame-to-frame assumption of brightness constancy and hence is able to track people under changing viewpoints, in grayscale image sequences, and with complex unknown backgrounds.},

abstract = {Maximizing the tracking performance of an industrial manipulator requires an accurate expression of manipulator dynamics and efficient model parameterization. These objectives are difficult to achieve in manipulators with flexible joints since link positions typically are not measured. We present in this paper an extended Kalman filter (EKF) observer to estimate manipulator states and couple these estimates to an adaptive rigid-link flexible-joint (RLFJ) controller. In a computer simulation, the EKF-RLFJ controller demonstrated superior tracking performance compared to a traditional adaptive controller. Experimental results for the Mitsubishi PA10-6CE showed improvements in tracking performance using the EKF-RLFJ controller with a 5 kg end-effector payload. Even greater improvements in tracking performance may be achieved in manipulators with significant joint flexibility.},
annote = {This paper attempts to estimate the position of rigid links and flexible joint (RLFJ) manipulator using discrete-time extended Kalman Filter as an observer for the robot model and control system. 

The uncertainties of the link and the motors' dynamics are modeled into the manipulator's dynamic equations. The position of the links are nonlinear because of the flexibility of the manipulator's joints.

The authors stress that EKF has non-optimal estimation as is the case of any algorithm that requires linearization. They performed a simulation and reiterate their models and algorithm on a Mitsubishi PA10-6CE manipulator experimentally. They observed improved tracking performance for highly flexible joints (joints under high torque) and low tracking performance for rigid joints. Thus, the authors introduce a mixed rigid-joint/flexible joint model to the EKF-RLFL controller which improved the overall tracking performance.

This observation is also seen in Haghighipanal et al. (2016)},

abstract = {Inspired by birds flying through cluttered environments such as dense forests, this paper studies the theoretical foundations of a novel motion planning problem: high-speed navigation through a randomly-generated obstacle field when only the statistics of the obstacle generating process are known a priori. Resembling a planar forest environment, the obstacle generating process is assumed to determine the locations and sizes of disk-shaped obstacles. When this process is ergodic, and under mild technical conditions on the dynamics of the bird, it is shown that the existence of an infinite collision-free trajectory through the forest exhibits a phase transition. On one hand, if the bird flies faster than a certain critical speed, then, with probability one, there is no infinite collision-free trajectory, i.e., the bird will eventually collide with some tree, almost surely, regardless of the planning algorithm governing the bird's motion. On the other hand, if the bird flies slower than this critical speed, then there exists at least one infinite collision-free trajectory, almost surely. Lower and upper bounds on the critical speed are derived for the special case of a homogeneous Poisson forest considering a simple model for the bird's dynamics. For the same case, an equivalent percolation model is provided. Using this model, the phase diagram is approximated in Monte-Carlo simulations. This paper also establishes novel connections between robot motion planning and statistical physics through ergodic theory and percolation theory, which may be of independent interest.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyze and discuss the performance and stability of a tailless micro aerial vehicle with flexible articulated wings. The dihedral angles can be varied symmetrically on both wings to control the aircraft speed independently of the angle of attack and flight-path angle, while an asymmetric dihedral setting can be used to control yaw in the absence of a vertical tail.Anonlinear aeroelastic model is derived, and it is used to study the steadystate performance and flight stability of the micro aerial vehicle. The concept of the effective dihedral is introduced, which allows for a unified treatment of rigid and flexible wing aircraft. It also identifies the amount of elasticity that is necessary to obtain tangible performance benefits over a rigid wing. The feasibility of using axial tension to stiffen the wing is discussed, and, at least in the context of a linear model, it is shown that adding axial tension is effective but undesirable. The turning performance of an micro aerial vehicle with flexible wings is compared to an otherwise identical micro aerial vehicle with rigid wings. The wing dihedral alone can be varied asymmetrically to perform rapid turns and regulate sideslip. The maximum attainable turn rate for a given elevator setting, however, does not increase unless antisymmetric wing twisting is employed. Copyright {\textcopyright}2011.},

abstract = {We present a hierarchical and adaptive mobile manipulator planner (HAMP) that plans for both the base and the arm in a judicious manner---allowing the manipulator to change its configuration autonomously when needed if the current arm configuration is in collision with the environment as the mobile manipulator moves along the planned path. This is in contrast to current implemented approaches that are conservative and fold the arm into a fixed home configuration. Our planner first constructs a base roadmap and then for each node in the roadmap it checks for collision status of current manipulator configuration along the edges formed with adjacent nodes, if the current manipulator configuration is in collision, the manipulator C-space is searched for a new reachable configuration such that it is collision-free as the mobile manipulator moves along the edge and a path from current configuration to the new reachable configuration is computed. We show that HAMP is probabilistically complete. We compared HAMP with full 9D PRM and observed that the full 9D PRM is outperformed by HAMP in each of the performance criteria, i.e., computational time, percentage of successful attempts, base path length, and most importantly, undesired motions of the arm. We also evaluated the tree versions of HAMP, with RRT and bi-directional RRT as core underlying sub-planners, and observed similar advantages, although the time saving for bi-directional RRT version is modest. We then present an extension of HAMP (we call it HAMP-U) that uses belief space planning to account for localization uncertainty associated with the mobile base position and ensures that the resultant path for the mobile manipulator has low uncertainty at the goal. Our experimental results show that the paths generated by HAMP-U are less likely to result in collision and are safer to execute than those generated by HAMP (without incorporating uncertainty), thereby showing the importance of incorporating base pose uncertainty in our overall HAMP algorithm.},

abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to propose a new view planning method which can be used to calculate the next-best-view (NBV) for multiple manipulators simultaneously and build an automated three-dimensional (3D) object reconstruction system, which is based on the proposed method and can adapt to various industrial applications. Design/methodology/approach – The entire 3D space is encoded with octree, which marks the voxels with different tags. A set of candidate viewpoints is generated, filtered and evaluated. The viewpoint with the highest score is selected as the NBV. Findings – The proposed method is able to make the multiple manipulators, equipped with “eye-in-hand” RGB-D sensors, work together to accelerate the object reconstruction process. Originality/value – Compared to the existed approaches, the proposed method in this paper is fast, computationally efficient, has low memory cost and can be used in actual industrial productions where the multiple different manipulators exist.

abstract = {This article reviews map-learning and path-planning strategies within the context of map-based navigation in mobile robots. Concerning map-learning, it distinguishes metric maps from topological maps and describes procedures that help maintain the coherency of these maps. Concerning path-planning, it distinguishes continuous from discretized spaces and describes procedures applicable when the execution of a plan fails. It insists on the need for an integrated conception of such procedures, which must be tightly tailored to the specific robot that is used, notably to the capacities and limitations of its sensory-motor equipment, and to the specific environment that is experienced. A hierarchy of navigation strategies is outlined in the discussion, together with the sort of adaptive capacities each affords to cope with unexpected obstacles or dangers encountered on an animat or robot's way to its goal. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Real-time motion planning of robots in a dynamic environment requires a continuous evaluation of the determined trajectory so as to avoid moving obstacles. This is even more challenging when the robot also needs to perform a task optimally while avoiding the obstacles due to the limited time available for generating a new collision-free path. In this paper, we propose the sequential expanded Lagrangian homotopy (SELH) approach, which is capable of determining the globally optimal robot's motion sequentially while satisfying the task constraints. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the capabilities of the approach by planning an optimal motion of a redundant mobile manipulator performing a complex trajectory. Comparison against existing optimal motion planning approaches, such as genetic algorithm (GA) and neural network (NN), shows that SELH is able to perform the planning at a faster rate. The considerably short computational time opens up an opportunity to apply this method in real time; and since the robot's motion is planned sequentially, it can also be adjusted to accommodate for dynamically changing constraints such as moving obstacles.},

@article{Meeussen2007,
abstract = {This paper presents a contribution to programming by human demonstration, in the context of compliant-motion task specification for sensor-controlled robot systems that physically interact with the environment. One wants to learn about the geometric parameters of the task and segment the total motion executed by the human into subtasks for the robot, that can each be executed with simple compliant-motion task specifications. The motion of the human demonstration tool is sensed with a 3-D camera, and the interaction with the environment is sensed with a force sensor in the human demonstration tool. Both measurements are uncertain, and do not give direct information about the geometric parameters of the contacting surfaces, or about the contact formations (CFs) encountered during the human demonstration. The paper uses a Bayesian sequential Monte Carlo method (also known as a particle filter) to do the simultaneous estimation of the CF (discrete information) and the geometric parameters (continuous information). The simultaneous CF segmentation and the geometric parameter estimation are helped by the availability of a contact state graph of all possible CFs. The presented approach applies to all compliant-motion tasks involving polyhedral objects with a known geometry, where the uncertain geometric parameters are the poses of the objects. This work improves the state of the art by scaling the contact estimation to all possible contacts, by presenting a prediction step based on the topological information of a contact state graph, and by presenting efficient algorithms that allow the estimation to operate in real time. In real-world experiments, it is shown that the approach is able to discriminate in real time between some 250 different CFs in the graph},
annote = {This paper present an approach to generate a path planning by human demonstration for a sensor based manipulator. A tool containing optical markers are tracked during demonstration phase using a 3D vision sensor (a Krypton 6D Optical System). The tool is attached to a geometrically uncertain object in a controlled environment. 

The use of 3D vision sensor, and the estimation of the state of the tool and indirect estimation of force asserted by the tool based on the state of the tool introduce uncertainty. To compromise the uncertainty, the authors use particle filtering technique to estimate:
the pose and twist of the manipulated object via tracking of the manipulating tool 
the force between the contacting object

The researcher address their previous work on the same problem and optimize the particle filter with toplogical graph called contact-state graph to predict the next best configuration of the object being moved or contact formation. They observed that the contact-state graph reduce the number of particles used during sampling which decrease computational load and increase accuracy in their estimation. 

The paper however did not replicate their simulation in an experimentation with an actual manipulator},

They are mounted on a target object and are observed by a camera that is equipped with an infrared-pass filter. The correspondences between LEDs and image detections are first determined using a combinatorial approach and then tracked using a constant-velocity model. The pose of the target object is estimated with a P3P algorithm and optimized by minimizing the reprojection error. Since the system works in the infrared spectrum, it is robust to cluttered environments and illumination changes. In a variety of experiments, we show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we successfully apply our system to stabilize a quadrotor both indoors and outdoors under challenging conditions. We release our implementation as open-source software.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Six mixtures with different Sm/Mg ratios as well as pure Sm and Mg samples were prepared. As a result of the low synthesis temperature the particles consist of amorphous metal carboxylate networks. The texture of the shells is governed by microporosity yielding the major part of the total surface area. A detailed investigation of thermal decomposition, crystallization, and grain growth behavior was carried out under constant heating rate conditions. The decomposition products are nanocrystalline Sm2O3 and MgO and corresponding two-phase nanocomposites. The pure samarium carboxylate gel features considerably higher thermal stability compared with the one comprised of only magnesium. Accordingly the decomposition behavior of mixed samples is dependent on the Sm/Mg ratio. Furthermore it is shown that small amounts of MgO are able to slow down the kinetics of grain growth of Sm2O3 whereas high amounts are necessary to significantly reduce the final grain size at 1000 degrees C.},

Our method utilizes properties of the solution to the Poisson equation to extract space-time features such as local space-time saliency, action dynamics, shape structure and orientation. We show that these features are useful for action recognition, detection and clustering. The method is fast, does not require video alignment and is applicable in (but not limited to) many scenarios where the background is known. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of our method to partial occlusions, non-rigid deformations, significant changes in scale and viewpoint, high irregularities in the performance of an action, and low quality video.},

abstract = {This work focuses on the performance investigation of consumer 3D sensors with respect to their repeatability and accuracy. It explores currently available sensors based on the 3D sensing technology developed by PrimeSense and introduced to the market in the form of the Microsoft Kinect. Accuracy and repeatability can be crucial criteria for the use of these sensors outside their intended use for home entertainment. The test strategies for the study are motivated by the VDI/VDE 2634 guideline. At the core of the work is the investigation of several units of the Asus Xtion Pro and the PrimeSense Developer Kit and a comparison of their performance. Altogether eighteen sensor units were tested. The results of the proposed test scenario for the sensor units show excellent repeatability at a few millimetres. However, absolute accuracy is worse and can be up to a few centimetres. Sensor performance varies greatly both for sensors of the same manufacturer and in-between manufacturers. {\textcopyright} 2014 E. Schweizerbart'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung, Stuttgart, Germany.},

abstract = {—With advancing technologies, robotic manipulators and visual environment sensors are becoming cheaper and more widespread. However, robot control can be still a limiting factor for better adaptation of these technologies. Robotic manipulators are performing very well in structured workspaces, but do not adapt well to unexpected changes, like people entering the workspace. We present a method combining 3D Camera based workspace mapping, and a predictive and reflexive robot manipulator trajectory estimation to allow more efficient and safer operation in dynamic workspaces. In experiments on a real UR5 robot our method has proven to provide shorter and smoother trajectories compared to a reactive trajectory planner in the same conditions. Furthermore, the robot has successfully avoided any contact by initialising the reflexive movement even when an obstacle got unexpectedly close to the robot. The main goal of our work is to make the operation more flexible in unstructured dynamic workspaces and not just avoid obstacles, but also adapt when performing collaborative tasks with humans in the near future.},
annote = {Mapping by Octomap

The author use the background of shared human-robot workspace as their problem statement. 
Method: Point clouds from the cameras are pre-processed using Statisitcal Outlier Removal algorithm to reject outliers. They proceed by merging point cloud data from two 3D cameras (Kinect Sensor) using iterative closest point. Iterative closest point (ICP) is often used in mobile robot to combine two scans collected at different position together. They use forward kinematic to assist in replacing point clouds corresponding to the robots chassis with cylindrical shapes. The map of the environment are model using octomap and embedded each grid cell with a decaying occupancy value. The decaying cost value are used to represent danger zone, a mediary zone, and a non-danger zone in the map for a reflexive and predictive behaviors. Building their path planning on top of these map provde a responsive motion even if the robot workspace is populated by moving objects. 


setup: the authors uses 6DOF UR5 robot. The authors adopt a eye-to-hand approach.

validation: they validate their method by simulating a predifined back and forth motion between a start configuration and a goal configuration. The first simulation act as the baseline or the benchmark of their path planning approach using only Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The second and the third experiments introduce a moving object into the robot's workspace but a reactive path planning and the reflexive-predictive path planning approaches are used respectively. They concluded that although experiments 3 performs at the shortest time, the result was not significant. 

ICP use in this method is computationally expensive because it involves direct point clouds.},

abstract = {Matching 2D range scans is a basic component of many localization and mapping algorithms. Most scan match algorithms require finding correspondences between the used features, i.e. points or lines. We propose an alternative representation for a range scan, the Normal Distributions Transform. Similar to an occupancy grid, we subdivide the 2D plane into cells. To each cell, we assign a normal distribution, which locally models the probability of measuring a point. The result of the transform is a piecewise continuous and differentiable probability density, that can be used to match another scan using Newton's algorithm. Thereby, no explicit correspondences have to be established. We present the algorithm in detail and show the application to relative position tracking and simultaneous localization and map building (SLAM). First results on real data demonstrate, that the algorithm is capable to map unmodified indoor environments reliable and in real time, even without using odometry data (see video).},
annote = {The authors present the design of two filtering techniques to estimate the acceleration and the jerk of five-bar linkage manipulator with flexible joints. These estimations helps in designing a better control.

Unlike a rigid joints, the flexible joints are time variant hence highly nonlinear. The nonlinearity introduce uncertainty to the dynamics of the manipulator making prediction of higher order dynamics such as accelerations and jerks uncertain. This is because a nonlinear system has no closed form solution and require linearization. The authors suggest the use of Euler-Langrange equations to represent the model of the manipulator dynamics given that each joints are model by torsional spring. 

To better estimate the acceleration and jerk of each link in the four-bar linkage, the linearization are manage using extended and unscented Kalman filters. 

The author validated their observer model by simulation and conclude that the accelaration and jerk of the manipulator's linkages are succesfully estimated.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel and general real-time adaptive motion planning (RAMP) approach suitable for planning trajectories of high-DOF or redundant robots, such as mobile manipulators, in dynamic environments with moving obstacles of unknown trajectories. The RAMP approach enables simultaneous path and trajectory planning and simultaneous planning and execution of motion in real time. It facilitates real-time optimization of trajectories under various optimization criteria, such as minimizing energy and time and maximizing manipulability. It also accommodates partially specified task goals of robots easily. The approach exploits redundancy in redundant robots (such as locomotion versus manipulation in a mobile manipulator) through loose coupling of robot configuration variables to best achieve obstacle avoidance and optimization objectives. The RAMP approach has been implemented and tested in simulation over a diverse set of task environments, including environments with multiple mobile manipulators. The results (and also the accompanying video) show that the RAMP planner, with its high efficiency and flexibility, not only handles a single mobile manipulator well in dynamic environments with various obstacles of unknown motions in addition to static obstacles, but can also readily and effectively plan motions for each mobile manipulator in an environment shared by multiple mobile manipulators and other moving obstacles. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

These works have questioned the need of features, in which consolidated SLAM techniques of the last decade were based. In this paper we present a novel feature-based monocular SLAM system that is more robust, gives more accurate camera poses, and obtains comparable or better semi-dense reconstructions than the cur- rent state of the art. Our semi-dense mapping operates over keyframes, optimized by local bundle adjustment, allowing to obtain accurate triangulations from wide baselines. Our novel method to search correspondences, the measurement fusion and the inter-keyframe depth consistency tests allow to obtain clean reconstructions with very few outliers. Against the current trend in direct SLAM, our experiments show that by decoupling the semi-dense reconstruction from the trajectory computation, the results obtained are better. This opens the discussion on the benefits of features even if a semi-dense reconstruction is desired.},

abstract = {Distribution of land cover has a profound impact on the climate and environment; mapping the land cover patterns from global, regional to local scales are important for scientists and authorities to yield better monitoring of the changing world. Satellite remote sensing has been demonstrated as an efficient tool to monitor the land cover patterns for a large spatial extent. Nevertheless, the demand on land cover maps at a finer scale (especially in urban areas) has been raised with evidence by numerous biophysical and socio-economic studies. This paper reviews the small-footprint LiDAR sensor - one of the latest high resolution airborne remote sensing technologies, and its application on urban land cover classification. While most of the early researches focus on the analysis of geometric components of 3D LiDAR data point clouds, there has been an increasing interest in investigating the use of intensity data, waveform data and multi-sensor data to facilitate land cover classification and object recognition in urban environment. In this paper, the advancement of airborne LiDAR technology, including data configuration, feature spaces, classification techniques, and radiometric calibration/correction is reviewed and discussed. The review mainly focuses on the LiDAR studies conducted during the last decade with an emphasis on identification of the approach, analysis of pros and cons, investigating the overall accuracy of the technology, and how the classification results can serve as an input for different urban environmental analyses. Finally, several promising directions for future LiDAR research are highlighted, in hope that it will pave the way for the applications of urban environmental modeling and assessment at a finer scale and a greater extent.},

abstract = {The probabilistic model of a laser scanner presents an important aspect for simultaneous localization and map-building (SLAM). However, the characteristic of the beam of the laser range finder under extreme incident angles approaching 90° has not been thoroughly investigated. This research paper reports the characteristic of the density of the range value coming from a laser range finder under close range circumstances where the laser is imposed with a high incident angle. The laser was placed in a controlled environment consisting of walls at a close range and 1000 iteration of scans was collected. The assumption of normal density of the metrical data collapses when the beam traverses across sharp edges in this environment. The data collected also shows multimodal density at instances where the range has discontinuity. The standard deviation of the laser range finder is reported to average at 10.54 mm, with 0.96 of accuracy. This significance suggests that under extreme incident angles, a laser range finder reading behaves differently compared to normal distribution. The use of this information is crucial for SLAM activity in enclosed environments such as inside piping grid or other cluttered environments.},

All the elements captured in the depth scene are recognized by means of an Ad-Hoc segmentation algorithm, which analyzes the raw depth data directly provided by the sensor. The system extracts the elements, and implements a solution to classify all the blobs in the scene. Anthropometric relationships and features are exploited to recognize one or more human subjects among the blobs. Once a person is detected, he is followed by a tracking algorithm between different frames. The use of a reference depth frame, containing the set-up of the scene, allows one to extract a human subject, even when he/she is interacting with other objects, such as chairs or desks. In addition, the problem of blob fusion is taken into account and efficiently solved through an inter-frame processing algorithm. A fall is detected if the depth blob associated to a person is near to the floor. Experimental tests show the effectiveness of the proposed solution, even in complex scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Occupancy probabilities are computed and stored in a multiresolution octree for improved performance and compactness. Occupancy models are built in local reference frames and linked to a global reference frame through uncertain spatial relationships that can be updated dynamically.

abstract = {The ability to detect people in domestic and unconstrained environments is crucial for every service robot. The knowledge where people are is required to perform several tasks such as navigation with dynamic obstacle avoidance and human-robot-interaction. In this paper we propose a people detection approach based on 3d data provided by a RGB-D camera. We introduce a novel 3d feature descriptor based on Local Surface Normals (LSN) which is used to learn a classifier in a supervised machine learning manner. In order to increase the systems flexibility and to detect people even under partial occlusion we introduce a top-down/bottom-up segmentation. We deployed the people detection system on a real-world service robot operating at a reasonable frame rate of 5Hz. The experimental results show that our approach is able to detect persons in various poses and motions such as sitting, walking, and running.},

abstract = {"Differential geometry began as the study of curves and surfaces using the methods of calculus. In time, the notions of curve and surface were generalized along with associated notions such as length, volume, and curvature. At the same time the topic has become closely allied with developments in topology. The basic object is a smooth manifold, to which some extra structure has been attached, such as a Riemannian metric, a symplectic form, a distinguished group of symmetries, or a connection on the tangent bundle. This book is a graduate-level introduction to the tools and structures of modern differential geometry. Included are the topics usually found in a course on differentiable manifolds, such as vector bundles, tensors, differential forms, de Rham cohomology, the Frobenius theorem and basic Lie group theory. The book also contains material on the general theory of connections on vector bundles and an in-depth chapter on semi-Riemannian geometry that covers basic material about Riemannian manifolds and Lorentz manifolds. An unusual feature of the book is the inclusion of an early chapter on the differential geometry of hypersurfaces in Euclidean space. There is also a section that derives the exterior calculus version of Maxwell's equations. The first chapters of the book are suitable for a one-semester course on manifolds. There is more than enough material for a year-long course on manifolds and geometry."--Publisher's website.

abstract = {The number of registration solutions in the literature has bloomed recently. The iterative closest point, for example, could be considered as the backbone of many laser-based localization and mapping systems. Although they are widely used, it is a common challenge to compare registration solutions on a fair base. The main limitation is to overcome the lack of accurate ground truth in current data sets, which usually cover environments only over a small range of organization levels. In computer vision, the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository pushed forward point cloud registration algorithms and object modeling fields by providing high-quality scanned objects with precise localization. We aim to provide similar high-caliber working material to the robotic and computer vision communities but with sceneries instead of objects. We propose eight point cloud sequences acquired in locations covering the environment diversity that modern robots are susceptible to encounter, ranging from inside an apartment to a woodland area. The core of the data sets consists of 3D laser point clouds for which supporting data (Gravity, Magnetic North and GPS) are given for each pose. A special effort has been made to ensure global positioning of the scanner within mm-range precision, independent of environmental conditions. This will allow for the development of improved registration algorithms when mapping challenging environments, such as those found in real-world situations.1},

Recently, the rapid development of inexpensive depth sensors (e.g. Microsoft Kinect) provides adequate accuracy for real-time full-body human tracking for activity recognition applications. In this paper, we create a complex human activity dataset depicting two person interactions, including synchronized video, depth and motion capture data. Moreover, we use our dataset to evaluate various features typically used for indexing and retrieval of motion capture data, in the context of real-time detection of interaction activities via Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Experimentally, we find that the geometric relational features based on distance between all pairs of joints outperforms other feature choices. For whole sequence classification, we also explore techniques related to Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) in which the sequence is represented by a bag of body-pose features. We find that the MIL based classifier outperforms SVMs when the sequences extend temporally around the interaction of interest.},

abstract = {Decision making on alternatives for risk reduction planning starts with an intelligence phase for recognition of the decision problems and identifying the objectives. Development of the alternatives and assigning the variable by decision makers to each alternative are employed to the design phase. The final phase evaluates the optimal choice by comparing the alternatives, defining indicators, assigning a weight to each and ranking them [4]. This process is referred to as Multi‐Criteria Decision Making analysis (MCDM), Multi‐Criteria Evaluation (MCE) or Multi‐Criteria Analysis (MCA). MCDM is performed by choice and prioritization and is defined based on Alternative, Value, Criteria and the Weights on the Criteria. MCDM can be classified as Multi Objective Decision Making (MODM) and Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM). Sometimes it can be referred to as Single or Group decision making and be based on these methods, and it can be achieved by certainty or uncertainty [1]. Malczewski [2] stated that the most projects using MCDM are based on single decision making. Nevertheless, group decision will give us benefits in the SDSS. It depends if each group has different choices of decisions [3]. The MCDM module is implemented for Multi‐Criteria Decision Making analysis (MCDM) incorporating monetary and non‐ monetary criteria in the analysis for the optimal alternative. The MCDM module consists of several components. The first step is to define criteria (or Indicators) which are subdivided into disadvantages (criteria that indicate the difficulty for implementing the risk reduction strategy, also referred to as costs) and advantages (criteria that indicate the favourability, also referred to as benefits). In the next step the stakeholders can use the developed web‐based tool for prioritizing criteria and setting up the decision matrix MCE METHODS There are many methods available for MCDM. These methods can be divided to deterministic, fuzzy and stochastic. When there is certainty in the alternatives, we go for deterministic and if uncertainty is apparent, fuzzy and stochastic models are useful. MCDM are introduced by different methods like [1] Weighted sum Model (WSM), Weighted Product Model (WPM), Analytic hierarchy process (AHP), Revised AHP, Elimination and Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE), TOPSIS (for the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) etc. The SDSS applies the most common and easiest way of MCDM known as WSM. In a later version of the SDSS, we might integrate TOPSIS and Fuzzy methods to the study and compare the results. The output of the Cost Benefit Analysis and the Risk Analysis will be used for the Multi‐Criteria decision making and for comparison between alternatives.},

abstract = {This study attempts to present a new and comprehensive cycle for the design of fixed wing micro air vehicles. The idea is to propose a complete cycle containing all micro air vehicles design subjects such as aerodynamics, stability, structure, and navigation. The main aim of the cycle is to decrease the designing time for an optimum design. In this method, the sizing process is started simultaneously, which involves the following cases: specification of mission and aviation plan; determination of planform and aspect ratio; constraint analysis; estimation of plane weight. Completion of these four phases results in the specification of the geometry and dimensions of the wing in an optimum manner. After determination of the planform geometry, selection of the airfoil is carried out by complying with the defined criteria. After this stage, the wing of micro air vehicle is designed completely and analysis is carried out to determine the aerodynamics coefficients. Next step is designing the fuselage for the airplane. Then micro air vehicle and aerodynamic center of wing are calculated and stability equations for micro air vehicle are simulated. The results of these processes are determination of surfaces, dimensions and airfoils of the tails and center of gravity of the plane. After calculation of the control surfaces, the designed micro air vehicle is analyzed in XFLR5 software. Next step is selection of electric equipment such as motor, batteries, servo, etc. The final step of design is the optimization of the micro air vehicle for increasing its performance and endurance. After the design, steps of manufacturing will be started.\r\n},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a robust end-to-end multi-modal pipeline for place recognition where the sensor systems can differ from the map building to the query. Our approach operates directly on images and LiDAR scans without requiring any local feature extraction modules. By projecting the sensor data onto the unit sphere, we learn a multi-modal descriptor of partially overlapping scenes using a spherical convolutional neural network. The employed spherical projection model enables the support of arbitrary LiDAR and camera systems readily without losing information. Loop closure candidates are found using a nearest-neighbor lookup in the embedding space. We tackle the problem of correctly identifying the closest place by correlating the candidates' power spectra, obtaining a confidence value per prospect. Our estimate for the correct place corresponds then to the candidate with the highest confidence. We evaluate our proposal w.r.t. state-of-the-art approaches in place recognition using real-world data acquired using different sensors. Our approach can achieve a recall that is up to 10 % and 5 % higher than for a LiDAR- and vision-based system, respectively, when the sensor setup differs between model training and deployment. Additionally, our place selection can correctly identify up to 95 % matches from the candidate set.},

abstract = {Point clouds provide a flexible geometric representation suitable for countless applications in computer graphics; they also comprise the raw output of most 3D data acquisition devices. While hand-designed features on point clouds have long been proposed in graphics and vision, however, the recent overwhelming success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis suggests the value of adapting insight from CNN to the point cloud world. Point clouds inherently lack topological information so designing a model to recover topology can enrich the representation power of point clouds. To this end, we propose a new neural network module dubbed EdgeConv suitable for CNN-based high-level tasks on point clouds including classification and segmentation. EdgeConv acts on graphs dynamically computed in each layer of the network. It is differentiable and can be plugged into existing architectures. Compared to existing modules operating in extrinsic space or treating each point independently, EdgeConv has several appealing properties: It incorporates local neighborhood information; it can be stacked applied to learn global shape properties; and in multi-layer systems affinity in feature space captures semantic characteristics over potentially long distances in the original embedding. We show the performance of our model on standard benchmarks including ModelNet40, ShapeNetPart, and S3DIS.},

In this paper, we present a real-time, sensor-based approach for ensuring the safety of people in close proximity to robots in an industrial workcell. Our approach fuses data from multiple 3D imaging sensors of different modalities into a volumetric evidence grid and segments the volume into regions corresponding to background, robots, and people. Surrounding each robot is a danger zone that dynamically updates according to the robot's position and trajectory. Similarly, surrounding each person is a dynamically updated safety zone. A collision between danger and safety zones indicates an impending actual collision, and the affected robot is stopped until the problem is resolved. We demonstrate and experimentally evaluate the concept in a prototype industrial workcell augmented with stereo and range cameras.},

This is mostly due to their high memory consumption caused by the necessity to store indicator variables for every label and transition. We propose a way to reduce the memory consumption of existing methods. Our approach is based on the observation that many semantic labels are only present at very localized positions in the scene, such as cars. Therefore this label does not need to be active at every location. We exploit this observation by dividing the scene into blocks in which generally only a subset of labels is active. By determining early on in the reconstruction process which labels need to be active in which block the memory consumption can be significantly reduced. In order to recover from mistakes we propose to update the set of active labels during the iterative optimization procedure based on the current solution. We also propose a way to initialize the set of active labels using a boosted classifier. In our experimental evaluation we show the reduction of memory usage quantitatively. Eventually, we show results of joint semantic 3D reconstruction and semantic segmentation with significantly more labels than previous approaches were able to handle.},

abstract = {Much of the technology that makes robots reliable, human friendly, and adaptable for numerous applications has emerged from manufacturers of industrial robots. With an estimated installation base in 2014 of about 1.5 million units, some 171000 new installations in that year and an annual turnover of the robotics industry estimated to be US$ 32 billion, industrial robots are by far the largest commercial application of robotics technology today. The foundations for robot motion planning and control were initially developed with industrial applications in mind. These applications deserve special attention in order to understand the origin of robotics science and to appreciate the many unsolved problems that still prevent the wider use of robots in today's agile manufacturing environments. In this chapter, we present a brief history and descriptions of typical industrial robotics applications and at the same time we address current critical state-of-the-art technological developments. We show how robots with different mechanisms fit different applications and how applications are further enabled by latest technologies, often adopted from technological fields outside manufacturing automation. We will first present a brief historical introduction to industrial robotics with a selection of contemporary application examples which at the same time refer to a critical key technology. Then, the basic principles that are used in industrial robotics and a review of programming methods will be outlined. We will also introduce the topic of system integration particularly from a data integration point of view. The chapter will be closed with an outlook based on a presentation of some unsolved problems that currently inhibit wider use of industrial robots.},

abstract = {Obstacle avoidance is a significant skill not only for mobile robots but also for robot manipulators working in unstructured environments. Various algorithms have been proposed to solve off-line planning and on-line adaption problems. However, it is still not able to ensure safety and flexibility in complex scenarios. In this paper, a novel obstacle avoidance algorithm is proposed to improve the robustness and flexibility. The method contains three components: A closed-loop control system is used to filter the preplanned trajectory and ensure the smoothness and stability of the robot motion; the dynamic repulsion field is adopted to fulfill the robot with primitive obstacle avoidance capability; to mimic human's complex obstacle avoidance behavior and instant decision-making mechanism, a parametrized decision-making force is introduced to optimize all the feasible motions. The algorithms were implemented in planar and spatial robot manipulators. The comparative results show the robot can not only track the task trajectory smoothly but also avoid obstacles in different configurations.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a high-dimensional map building technique that incorporates raw pixelated semantic measurements into the map representation. The proposed technique uses Gaussian Processes (GPs) multi-class classification for map inference and is the natural extension of GP occupancy maps from binary to multi-class form. The technique exploits the continuous property of GPs and, as a result, the map can be inferred with any resolution. In addition, the proposed GP Semantic Map (GPSM) learns the structural and semantic correlation from measurements rather than resorting to assumptions, and can flexibly learn the spatial correlation as well as any additional non-spatial correlation between map points. We extend the OctoMap to Semantic OctoMap representation and compare with the GPSM mapping performance using NYU Depth V2 dataset. Evaluations of the proposed technique on multiple partially labeled RGBD scans and labels from noisy image segmentation show that the GP semantic map can handle sparse measurements, missing labels in the point cloud, as well as noise corrupted labels.},

abstract = {Depression is a commonly occurring mental disorder, which is characterized by dysfunctional inhibition and facilitation for emotional stimuli. The aim of the present study was to investigate distracter inhibition and facilitation for emotional faces in depressed individuals in a negative affective priming task. Control participants who had never suffered from depression (NC), sub-clinically depressed participants, and participants diagnosed with a current major depressive disorder (MDD), Anxiety Inventory, the Hamilton Depression Rating Score were recruited using the Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck and DSM-IV as tools. Twenty-four participants in each group completed a negative affective priming task. The main finding was that there were no significant differences among the three groups in the positive and negative priming effects of happy faces. However, there were significant differences for positive and negative priming effects of sad faces between each pair of groups, with the effects being lowest for MDD and highest for NC participants. It can be concluded that depressed individuals are characterized by enhanced facilitation and deficient inhibition for negative materials, which is a stable cognitive vulnerability risk, possibly associated with the occurrence of depression. There are differences in the cognitive dysfunction for negative stimuli between clinically depressed and sub-clinically depressed individuals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The problem of estimating position and orientation (pose) of an object in real time constitutes an important issue for vision-based control of robots. Many vision-based pose-estimation schemes in robot control rely on an extended Kalman filter (EKF) that requires tuning of filter parameters. To obtain satisfactory results, EKF-based techniques rely on “known” noise statistics, initial object pose, and sufficiently high sampling rates for good approximation of measurement-function linearization. Deviations from such assumptions usually lead to degraded pose estimation during visual servoing. In this paper, a new algorithm, namely iterative adaptive EKF (IAEKF), is proposed by integrating mechanisms for noise adaptation and iterative-measurement linearization. The experimental results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of IAEKF in dealing with erroneous a priori statistics, poor pose initialization, variations in the sampling rate, and trajectory dynamics.},

This paper demonstrate an adaptive iterative extended Kalman filter (AIEKF) in the absence of accurate inital pose, noise matrix, and covariance matrix at variant sampling rate during robotic visual servoing. Visual servoing is a process of estimating the configuration of a manipulator using images or visual feedbacks.

They experimented on a six degree of freedom cartesian manipulator AFMA-6 with eye-in-hand camera configuration. The robot moves at a predefined trajectory under different condition. Each separate experimentation involves increasing the velocity of the end effector, changing the covariance matrices, changing the sampling time for estimation, and changing the intial positions of the end effector. They compared three other Kalman filtering techniques (extended Kalman filter, adaptive extended Kalman filter, and iterative extended Kalman filter) with the IAEKF. They conclude that IAEKF can improve pose estimation at during uncertain initial position and covariance matrix estimation, high motion, and slow sampling rate},

abstract = {Gliding birds continually change the shape and size of their wings, presumably to exploit the profound effect of wing morphology on aerodynamic performance. That birds should adjust wing sweep to suit glide speed has been predicted qualitatively by analytical glide models, which extrapolated the wing's performance envelope from aerodynamic theory. Here we describe the aerodynamic and structural performance of actual swift wings, as measured in a wind tunnel, and on this basis build a semi-empirical glide model. By measuring inside and outside swifts' behavioural envelope, we show that choosing the most suitable sweep can halve sink speed or triple turning rate. Extended wings are superior for slow glides and turns; swept wings are superior for fast glides and turns. This superiority is due to better aerodynamic performance-with the exception of fast turns. Swept wings are less effective at generating lift while turning at high speeds, but can bear the extreme loads. Finally, our glide model predicts that cost-effective gliding occurs at speeds of 8-10 m s(-1), whereas agility-related figures of merit peak at 15-25 m s(-1). In fact, swifts spend the night ('roost') in flight at 8-10 m s(-1) (ref. 11), thus our model can explain this choice for a resting behaviour. Morphing not only adjusts birds' wing performance to the task at hand, but could also control the flight of future aircraft.},

Human activity understanding from RGB-D data has attracted increasing attention since the first work reported in 2010. Over this period, many benchmark datasets have been created to facilitate the development and evaluation of new algorithms. However, the existing datasets are mostly captured in laboratory environment with small number of actions and small variations, which impede the development of higher level algorithms for real world applications. Thus, this paper proposes a large scale dataset along with a set of evaluation protocols. The large dataset is created by combining several existing publicly available datasets and can be expanded easily by adding more datasets. The large dataset is suitable for testing algorithms from different perspectives using the proposed evaluation protocols. Four state-of-the-art algorithms are evaluated on the large combined dataset and the results have verified the limitations of current algorithms and the effectiveness of the large dataset.},

abstract = {We propose PHASER, a correspondence-free global registration of sensor-centric pointclouds that is robust to noise, sparsity, and partial overlaps. Our method can seamlessly handle multimodal information, and does not rely on keypoint nor descriptor preprocessing modules.By exploiting properties ofFourier analysis, PHASER operates directly on the sensor's signal, fusing the spectra of multiple channels and computing the 6-DoF transformation based on correlation. Our registration pipeline starts by finding the most likely rotation r ϵ SO(3) followed by computing the most likely translation t ϵ R3. Both estimates, r, and t are distributed according to a probability distribution that takes the underlying manifold into account, i.e., a Bingham and a Gaussian distribution, respectively. This further allows our approach to consider the periodic-nature of r and naturally represents its uncertainty. We extensively compare PHASER against several well-knownregistration algorithms on both simulated datasets, and real-world data acquired using different sensor configurations.Our results show that PHASER can globally align pointclouds in less than 100 ms with an average accuracy of 2 cmand 0.5°, is resilient against noise, and can handle partial overlap.},

Our library is based on hierarchical representations and designed to perform multiple proximity queries on different model representations. The set of queries includes discrete collision detection, continuous collision detection, separation distance computation and penetration depth estimation. The input models may correspond to triangulated rigid or deformable models and articulated models. Moreover, FCL can perform probabilistic collision checking between noisy point clouds that are captured using cameras or LIDAR sensors. The main benefit of FCL lies in the fact that it provides a unified interface that can be used by various applications. Furthermore, its flexible architecture makes it easier to implement new algorithms within this framework. The runtime performance of the library is comparable to state of the art collision and proximity algorithms. We demonstrate its performance on synthetic datasets as well as motion planning and grasping computations performed using a two-armed mobile manipulation robot. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Heuristic searches such as A* search are highly popular means of finding least-cost plans due to their generality, strong theoretical guarantees on completeness and optimality and simplicity in the implementation. In planning for robotic manipulation however, these techniques are commonly thought of as impractical due to the high-dimensionality of the planning problem. In this paper, we present a heuristic searchbased manipulation planner that does deal effectively with the high-dimensionality of the problem. The planner achieves the required efficiency due to the following three factors: (a) its use of informative yet fast-to-compute heuristics; (b) its use of basic (small) motion primitives as atomic actions; and (c) its use of ARA* search which is an anytime heuristic search with provable bounds on solution suboptimality. Our experimental analysis on a real mobile manipulation platform with a 7-DOF robotic manipulator shows the ability of the planner to solve manipulation in cluttered spaces by generating consistent, low-cost motion trajectories while providing guarantees on completeness and bounds on suboptimality. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

In this method, a position marker and an IMU are required to be rigidly attached to the robot tool to obtain the position of the manipulator from the position sensor and the orientation of the manipulator from the IMU in real time. An efficient approach that incorporates a Kalman filter (KF) and a particle filter to estimate the position and orientation of the manipulator is proposed in this paper. The use of these pose (orientation and position) estimation methods improves the reliability and accuracy of pose measurements. Finally, an extended KF is used to estimate the kinematic parameter errors. The primary advantage of this method over existing automated self-calibration methods is that it does not involve complex steps, such as camera calibration, corner detection, and laser alignment, which makes the proposed robot calibration procedure more auton},

Kinematic errors occur because of imperfection in serial robot components, their wear, misalignment and other factors.

-Particle filters is used to estimate the orientation of the end point of the serial robot

-Kalman filter is used to estimate the position of the end point of the serial robot

-The EKF is used to optimize the position and orientation estimation of the end point of the robot. By using the Jacobian matrices, the authors estimate the kinematic erros of the serial robot to manage the uncertainty of using IMU measurements.

They compared their EKF approach to a linear Least Square technique for their estimation of each joints in the robot. The EKF has llower error for all six joint parameters estimation.

Many previous works use a pheromone deposition scheme that assumes perfect localization of the robot, in which, robots precisely know their location in the map. Therefore, pheromones are always assumed to be deposited at the desired place. However, it is difficult to achieve perfect localization of the robot due to errors in encoders and sensors attached to the robot and the dynamics of the environment in which the robot operates. In real-world scenarios, there is always some uncertainty associated in estimating the pose (i.e. position and orientation) of the mobile service robot. Failing to model this uncertainty would result in service robots depositing pheromones at wrong places.

abstract = {In the last decade, visual odometry (VO) has attracted significant research attention within the computer vision community. Most of the works have been carried out using standard visible-band cameras. These sensors offer numerous advantages but also suffer from some drawbacks such as illumination variations and limited operational time (i.e., daytime only). In this paper, we explore techniques that allow us to extend the concepts beyond the visible spectrum. We introduce a localization solution based on a pair of thermal cameras. We focus on VO and demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed solution in daytime as well as night-time. The first challenge with thermal cameras is their geometric calibration. Here, we propose a solution to overcome this issue and enable stereopsis. VO requires a good set of feature correspondences. We use a combination of Fast-Hessian detector with for Fast Retina Keypoint descriptor for that purpose. A range of optimization techniques can be used to compute the incremental motion. Here, we propose the double dogleg algorithm and show that it presents an interesting alternative to the commonly used Levenberg-Marquadt approach. In addition, we explore thermal 3-D reconstruction and show that similar performance to the visible-band can be achieved. In order to validate the proposed solution, we build an innovative experimental setup to capture various data sets, where different weather and time conditions are considered.},

Mobile manipulators present a unique set of challenges for the planning algorithms, as they are usually kinematically redundant and dynamically complex owing to the different dynamic behavior of the mobile base and the manipulator. The purpose of this article is to systematically review the different planning algorithms specifically used for mobile manipulator motion planning. Depending on how the two subsystems are treated during planning, sampling-based, optimization-based, search-based, and other planning algorithms are grouped into two broad categories. Then, planning algorithms are dissected and discussed based on common components. The problem of dealing with the kinematic redundancy in calculating the goal configuration is also analyzed. While planning separately for the mobile base and the manipulator provides convenience, the results are sub-optimal. Coordinating between the mobile base and manipulator while utilizing their unique capabilities provides better solution paths. Based on the analysis, challenges faced by the current planning algorithms and future research directions are presented.},

The learning problem is divided into two separate subproblems: choosing grasping points and predicting the quality of a given grasp. For each grasp we store location parameters that code the locations of the grasping points, quality parameters that are relevant features for the assessment of grasp quality, and the associated grade. The location parameters, using a special coding which is not object specific, are used to locate grasping points on new target objects. A function from the quality parameters to the grade is learned from examples. Grasp quality for novel situations can be generalized and estimated using the learned function. An experimental setup using an AdeptOne manipulator was developed to test this scheme. The system had demonstrated an ability to grasp a relatively wide variety of objects, and its performance had significantly improved with practice following a small number of trials.

abstract = {This paper presents a real-time calculation method to generate the trajectory of robot manipulator for the purpose of avoiding collision. In order to model 3-D workspace, we use Octree which has been used for fast collision detection. Path planning is done at two levels. First, a global planner finds a sub-goal in the 3-D workspace using the structure of Octree. Then a local planner searches the path to the sub-goal in the joint space. If the local planner fails, a new sub-goal is selected by the global planner and subsequently examined by the local planner. In the local planner, the levels of Octree are used as the cost function to represent the distance between the manipulator and the obstacles. This criterion is not exact, but, due to this, we can obtain the approximate feasible trajectory extremely quickly. We will show the effectiveness of our method with some simulation examples.},

abstract = {A method based on an Unscented Kalman Filter is presented for collision detection and control of parallel-structured two-link flexible manipulators. The exact dynamics of parallel-structured two-link flexible manipulators is described by nonlinear partial and ordinary differential equations having considerable complexity. Here, manipulators are modeled approximately by a two-link flexible manipulator consisting of a pair of flexible beams under the same boundary conditions as the original system. To discover the instant at which the flexible manipulator collides with an unknown obstacle, the innovation of the Unscented Kalman Filter - a nonlinear state estimator - is introduced. To control the manipulator, a sliding mode controller is employed. Under the normal conditions, the sliding mode controller generates control torques such that the tip position of the manipulator follows a given reference trajectory. However, when collision between the flexible manipulator and an obstacle is detected, the controller switches from position control to suspend control by changing the reference trajectory. The performance of the proposed collision detection algorithm and controller is demonstrated via two numerical simulations. {\textcopyright} 2012 ISSN 1349-4198.},

They introduce a collision input into the observation model of the UKF. The collision is detected by a piezoelectric sensors attach at the base of the links. An abnormal reading from the piezoeletric sensors would trigger the collision input and change the parameters of the UKF to suspend control of the manipulator.

To achieve this goal, an image-based grasping design is combined with a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM). The proposed vSLAM method is based on extended Kalman filter (EKF) and a Kinect RGBD sensor. In the manipulator design, the robot arms are designed to be able to configure as a handrail for user support in execution of walking assistance tasks. The purpose of this design is to perform mobile manipulation and walking assistance tasks on the same robot. Experiments on the prototype dual-arm mobile manipulator validate that the proposed method can find and grasp a target object after navigation a distance to the object position. After the robot delivered the object to the user, it configured to provide walking assist to the user using the suggested compliance controller.},
annote = {This paper present two problems and two solutions. One is on self localization, a SLAM problem which they solved using EKF-SLAM and the other is on grasping problem. We will only regard the grasping problem since it directly involve manipulation under uncertainty.

During object identification, the authors raised the concern of matching error during identification which may result in misleading object recognition. They mitigate the problem using random sample consensus algorithm (RANSAC) to reject outliers adn to find the homography matrix. Homography matrix transforms points in one image to the corresponding points in another image when a camera changes in position.

The result of their investigation suggest a successful object retriaval to a person. They did not, however, present any comparison of their result with other approach for the Grasping problem.},

abstract = {In recent years the Robot Operating System (Quigley et al. 2009) (ROS) has become the 'de facto' standard framework for robotics software development. The ros_control framework provides the capability to implement and manage robot controllers with a focus on both real-time performance and sharing of controllers in a robot-agnostic way. The primary motivation for a sepate robot-control framework is the lack of realtime-safe communication layer in ROS. Furthermore, the framework implements solutions for controller-lifecycle and hardware resource management as well as abstractions on hardware interfaces with minimal assumptions on hardware or operating system. The clear, modular design of ros_control makes it ideal for both research and industrial use and has indeed seen many such applications to date. The idea of ros_control originates from the pr2_controller_manager framework specific to the PR2 robot but ros_control is fully robot-agnostic. Controllers expose standard ROS interfaces for out-of-the box 3rd party solutions to robotics problems like manipulation path planning (MoveIt! (Chitta, Sucan, and Cousins 2012)) and autonomous navigation (the ROS navigation stack). Hence, a robot made up of a mobile base and an arm that support ros_control doesn't need any additional code to be written, only a few controller configuration files and it is ready to navigate autonomously and do path planning for the arm. ros_control also provides several libraries to support writing custom controllers.},

A key contribution is the design of two families of motion primitives for aerial robots flying in dense obstacle fields, along with rules to stitch them together. The primitives are obtained by solving for the flight dynamics of the aerial robot, and explicitly account for limited agility using time delays. The first family of primitives consists of turning maneuvers to link any two points in space. The locations of the terminal points are used to obtain closed-form expressions for the control inputs required to fly between them, while accounting for the finite time required to switch between consecutive sets of control inputs. The second family consists of aggressive turn-around maneuvers wherein the time delay between the angle of attack and roll angle commands is used to optimize the maneuver for the spatial constraints. A 3-D motion planning algorithm based on these primitives is presented for aircraft flying through a dense forest.},

Two feature selection methods including Minimal-redundancy maximal-relevancy (mRMR) and Maximal relevance (Max-Relevance) are used to further improve the classification accuracy. Finally, a detailed comparison of classification performance is presented, where classifier LR with seven optimal feature subset reaches a classification precision of 78.41%, which validates the feasibility of applying machine learning to the terrorism field. We have stressed that the classification methods can be used to map different inherent types in terrorism with both high accuracy and fast speed. Besides, a well-chosen feature selection can lead to the decrement of classification error.},

abstract = {Remote Sensing technologies are capable of providing high-resolution spatial data needed to set up advanced flood simulation models. Amongst them, aerial Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) surveys or Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS) systems have long been used to provide digital topographic maps. Nowadays, Remote Sensing data are commonly used to create Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) for detailed urban-flood modelling. However, the difficulty of relying on top-view LiDAR data only is that it cannot detect whether passages for floodwaters are hidden underneath vegetated areas or beneath overarching structures such as roads, railroads, and bridges. Such (hidden) small urban features can play an important role in urban flood propagation. In this paper, a complex urban area of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia was chosen as a study area to simulate the extreme flooding event that occurred in 2003. Three different DTMs were generated and used as input for a two-dimensional (2D) urban flood model. A top-view LiDAR approach was used to create two DTMs: (i) a standard LiDAR-DTM and (ii) a Filtered LiDAR-DTM taking into account specific ground-view features. In addition, a Structure from Motion (SfM) approach was used to detect hidden urban features from a sequence of ground-view images; these ground-view SfM data were then combined with top-view Filtered LiDAR data to create (iii) a novel Multidimensional Fusion of Views-Digital Terrain Model (MFV-DTM). These DTMs were then used as a basis for the 2D urban flood model. The resulting dynamic flood maps are compared with observations at six measurement locations. It was found that when applying only top-view DTMs as input data, the flood simulation results appear to have mismatches in both floodwater depths and flood propagation patterns. In contrast, when employing the top-ground-view fusion approach (MFV-DTM), the results not only show a good agreement in floodwater depth, but also simulate more correctly the floodwater dynamics around small urban feature. Overall, the new multi-view approach of combining top-view LiDAR data with ground-view SfM observations shows a good potential for creating an accurate digital terrain map which can be then used as an input for a numerical urban flood model.},

abstract = {We describe the design of an aerial robot inspired by birds and the underlying theoretical developments leading to novel control and closed-loop guidance algorithms for a perching maneuver. A unique feature of this robot is that it uses wing articulation to control the flight path angle as well as the heading angle. It lacks a vertical tail for improved agility, which results in unstable lateral-directional dynamics. New closed-loop motion planning algorithms with guaranteed stability are obtained by rewriting the flight dynamic equations in the spatial domain rather than as functions of time, after which dynamic inversion is employed.

Such a state is an Inevitable Collision State (ICS). The ICS concept is particularly useful for navigation in dynamic environments because it takes into account the future behaviour of the moving objects. Accordingly it requires a model of the future evolution of the environment. In the real-world, the future trajectories of the obstacles are generally unknown and only estimates are available. This paper introduces a probabilistic formulation of the ICS concept which incorporates uncertainty in the model of the future trajectories of the obstacles.

abstract = {This paper proposes a general motion planning and coordination strategy for robot systems. The representation space (RS) of a robot system is constructed to describe the distributions of system attributes. The reachable area in the RS, denoting the attribute set that the system can be of, indicates the system's ability to accomplish tasks. Moreover, it also describes the influences of the internal and external constraints on the system's capability. Task realization is transformed to finding a trajectory in the RS for the system attributes to transit along under constraints. Meanwhile, the realizable conditions of a prescribed task by the robot system of specific configurations are discussed. If the task is realizable, the optimal strategy for task execution could further be figured out. Otherwise, it could be transformed to be realizable via task reassignment or system reconfigurations so that a connected path could be found for the transition of the system attributes from the starting point to the goal in the RS. The proposed scheme contributes to designing, planning, and coordination of the robotic tasks. Experiments on path planning of a robot manipulator and formation movement of a multirobot system, as well as coordination of a mobile manipulator system, are conducted to show the validity and generalization of the proposed method. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {Building a map, localizing within the map, and planning using the map are fundamental prob- lems for mobile robotics. Every mobile robotic system must incorporate some type of solution to all three problems. While the interdependency between mapping and localization is well known as the Simul- taneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem, there is a growing understanding in the research community that planning how the robot goes about mapping and exploring an environ- ment (and operating in the environment afterwards) can avoid degenerate conditions and signifi- cantly reduce complexity of SLAM. Thus the task of exploring a new environment combines all three problems, since the robot must plan to find actions that reduce uncertainty in both mapping and localization. This combined problem is known as Active SLAM. Independently, SLAM and planning have been solved in small, two dimensional, structured domains. Robots need to move beyond these simple environments. The challenge is to develop real-time Active SLAM methods that allow robots to explore large, three dimensional, unstruc- tured environments, and allow subsequent operation in these environments over long periods of time. But scaling up to truly large environments requires a second key insight beyond Active SLAM: to circumvent the scale limitations inherent in SLAM, the world can be divided up into more manageable pieces, or submaps. The SLAM problem then becomes a segmented SLAM problem, which represents the world with a combined metric and topological map, building met- ric submaps as necessary and refining the topological relationships between submaps. The contribution of this thesis is a real-time Active SLAM approach that combines a novel evidence grid-based volumetric representation, a robust Rao-Blackwellized particle-filter, a topo- logically flexible submap segmentation framework, and an integrated stochastic planning method for reducing SLAM uncertainty and predicting possible loop closures based on local map struc- ture. We demonstrate our methods on several robotic platforms in both structured and unstruc- tured large, three dimensional environments.},

These claims are supported by extensive numerical experiments from our implementation in C on DEC, HP, SGI and Linux Pentium platforms.

abstract = {We propose a SPAM (simultaneous planning and mapping) technique for a manipulator-type robot working in an uncertain environment via a novel Best Next Move algorithm. Demands for a smart decision to move a manipulator such as humanoid arms in uncertain or crowded environments call for a simultaneous planning and mapping technique. In the present work, we focus more on rapid map generation rather than global path search to reduce ignorance level of a given environment. The motivation is that the global path quality will be improved as the ignorance level of the unknown environment decreases. The 3D sensor introduced in the previous work has been improved for better mapping capability and the real-time rehearsal idea is used for {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±-space cloud point generation. Captured cloud points by 3D sensors, then, create an instantaneous {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±-space map whereby the Best Next Move algorithm directs the local motion of the manipulator. The direction of the Best Next Move utilizes the gradient of the density distribution of the {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±-nearest-neighborhood sets in {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±-space. It has a tendency of traveling along the direction by which the point clouds spread in space, thus rendering faster mapping of {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±-space obstacles possible. The proposed algorithm is compared with a sensor-based algorithm such as sensor-based RRT for performance comparison. Performance measures, such as mapping efficiency, search time, and total number of {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±-space point clouds, are reported as well. Possible applications include semiautonomous telerobotics planning and humanoid arm path planning.},
annote = {THIS SHOULD GO UNDER UNCERTAINTY IN UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENT

The paper present a simultaneous planning and mapping for a three degree of freedoom manipulator in an unknown environment. The paper argue that their method handle the uncertainty of the unknown environment by using virtual skin concept. The manipulator explores the environment using a mono-vision infrared proximity array (IPA) sensor which replicate the characteristic of a tactile-sensitive skin. From this exploration, the robot would model its configuration space (c-space) and use it as the input for their best-next-move algorithm to optimize path planning.The IPA sensors are attached on each links of the manipulator. Readers should note that an IPA sensor has limited range and noise bound output which add more uncertainty to the estimation of the manipulators c-space. 

The researcher address the noise in the sensor using group average feature (GAF). The point clouds generate from the IPA go through GAF algorithm to produce a more confident map of the c-space. 

The generated map of the c-space is used to provide motion planning for the robot manipulator. The rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) path planning algorithm use the map as an input to plan the motion of the manipulator. The authors optimized the RRT algorithm with their best next move (BNM) algorithm. BNM is reactive and does not use any inverse kinematic solution. 

They validate the method using and compare the RRT-BNM method with RRT method by simulation and showed that the RRT-BNM method has higher mapping efficiency. They defined mapping efficiency as percentage of map built compared to the actual map, over the number of point clouds in the c-space. Due to the GAF decompression method, the RTT-BNM produce map with less point clouds. 
The author, however, did not repeat the RRT experimentally. 

THE PAPER DID NOT CONCERN WITH LINK POSITION ERROR 
Despite the higher efficiency of RTT-BNM path planning, the map produce does not represent an accurate geometric information of the unknown environment explored by the manipulator. I believe this is because there is a lack of pose estimation of the manipulators link since the research disregard the use of inverse kinematics, bayesian or non-bayesian filtering techniques to reconcile with the path planning.},

abstract = {This paper presents a large-scale 3D environment mapping solution for mobile robots that is based on hybrid metric-topological maps. If a robot performs simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) while exploring an unknown environment, sometimes loops are closed and the whole SLAM graph has to be optimized. If a conventional occupancy grid mapping algorithm using a monolithic map is used, the whole occupancy grid map has to be rebuilt after optimization, which for large maps can easily become too time consuming for real-time operation. In the same way, path planning on very large occupancy grid maps can become computationally too expensive. Hybrid metric-topological maps can solve both problems. The global metric map is divided into sub-maps and a global topological graph is formed on the map. This allows recomputing only isolated areas of the map, whereas others can remain unchanged. The topological graph allows efficient path planning on the hybrid map. We show that the hybrid mapping approach presented here is considerably faster than conventional methods. Within the same time, it can generate more detailed maps of large environments. The computation time for maps with identical level of detail can be improved by up to two orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {In this document we describe a C++ framework for performing the optimization of nonlinear least squares problems that can be embedded as a graph or in a hyper-graph. A hyper-graph is an extension of a graph where an edge can connect multiple nodes and not only two. Several problems in robotics and in computer vision require to find the optimum of an error function with respect of a set of parameters. Examples include, popular applications like SLAM and Bundle adjustment. In the literature, many approaches have been proposed to address this class of problems. The naive implementation of standard methods, like Levenberg-Marquardt or Gauss-Newton can lead to acceptable results for most applications, when the correct parameterization is chosen. However, to achieve the maximum performances substantial efforts might be required. g 2 o stands for General (Hyper) Graph Optimization. The purposes of this framework are the follow-ing: • To provide an easy-to-extend and easy-to-use general library for graph optimization that can be easily applied to different problems, • To provide people who want to understand SLAM or BA with an easy-to-read implementation that focuses on the relevant details of the problem specification. • Achieve state-of-the-art performances, while being as general as possible. In the remainder of this document we will first characterize the (hyper) graph-embeddable problems, and we will give an introduction to their solution via the popular Levenberg-Marquardt or Gauss-Newton algorithms implemented in this library. Subsequently, we will describe the high-level behavior of the library, and the basic structures. Finally, we will introduce how to implement 2D SLAM as a simple example.},

abstract = {In writing this book, I was guided by my long-standing experience and interest in teaching discrete mathematics. For the student, my purpose was to present material in a precise, readable manner, with the concepts and techniques of discrete mathematics clearly presented and demonstrated. My goal was to show the relevance and practicality of discrete mathematics to students, who are often skeptical. I wanted to give students studying computer science all of the mathematical foundations they need for their future studies. I wanted to give mathematics students an understanding of important mathematical concepts together with a sense of why these concepts are important for applications. And most importantly, I wanted to accomplish these goals without watering down the material. For the instructor, my purpose was to design a flexible, comprehensive teaching tool using proven pedagogical techniques in mathematics. I wanted to provide instructors with a package of materials that they could use to teach discrete mathematics effectively and efficiently in the most appropriate manner for their particular set of students. I hope that I have achieved these goals. I have been extremely gratified by the tremendous success of this text. The many improvements in the seventh edition have been made possible by the feedback and suggestions of a large number of instructors and students at many of the more than 600 North American schools, and at any many universities in parts of the world, where this book has been successfully used. This text is designed for a one- or two-term introductory discrete mathematics course taken by students in a wide variety of majors, including mathematics, computer science, and engineering. College algebra is the only explicit prerequisite, although a certain degree of mathematical maturity is needed to study discrete mathematics in a meaningful way.

Scan represents, here, a set of range measurements of the features transformed into a binary image in the environment provided by a laser range finder (LRF). By comparing a scan taken at the current pose of the robot with an existing scan, an estimate of the absolute pose of the robot is obtained. Real world experiments with a robot within a confined environment show that the pose error is small enough to allow performance of navigation tasks.},

abstract = {We present a technique to estimate the egomotion of an RGB-D sensor based on rotations of functions defined on the unit sphere. In contrast to traditional approaches, our technique is not based on image features and does not require correspondences to be generated between frames of data. Instead, consecutive functions are correlated using spherical harmonic analysis. An Extended Gaussian Image (EGI), created from the local normal estimates of a point cloud, defines each function. Correlations are efficiently computed using Fourier transformations, resulting in a 3 Degree of Freedom (3-DoF) rotation estimate. An Iterative Closest Point (ICP) process then refines the initial rotation estimate and adds a translational component, yielding a full 6-DoF egomotion estimate. The focus of this work is to investigate the merits of using spherical harmonic analysis for egomotion estimation by comparison with alternative 6-DoF methods. We compare the performance of the proposed technique with that of stand-alone ICP and image feature based methods. As with other egomotion techniques, estimation errors accumulate and degrade results, necessitating correction mechanisms for robust localization. For this report, however, we use the raw estimates; no filtering or smoothing processes are applied. In-house and external benchmark data sets are analyzed for both runtime and accuracy. Results show that the algorithm is competitive in terms of both accuracy and runtime, and future work will aim to combine the various techniques into a more robust egomotion estimation framework. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Six mixtures with different Sm/Mg ratios as well as pure Sm and Mg samples were prepared. As a result of the low synthesis temperature the particles consist of amorphous metal carboxylate networks. The texture of the shells is governed by microporosity yielding the major part of the total surface area. A detailed investigation of thermal decomposition, crystallization, and grain growth behavior was carried out under constant heating rate conditions. The decomposition products are nanocrystalline Sm2O3 and MgO and corresponding two-phase nanocomposites. The pure samarium carboxylate gel features considerably higher thermal stability compared with the one comprised of only magnesium. Accordingly the decomposition behavior of mixed samples is dependent on the Sm/Mg ratio. Furthermore it is shown that small amounts of MgO are able to slow down the kinetics of grain growth of Sm2O3 whereas high amounts are necessary to significantly reduce the final grain size at 1000 degrees C.},

This article describes the extension of the proposed algorithm to deal with these additional DoFs and the resulting non-linearities. Simplifications using Taylor expansion and Cholesky decomposition yield a fast application that handles the massive amount of 3D data and the computational requirements due to the 6DoF. Our experiments demonstrate the functionality of estimating the exact poses and their covariances in all 6DoF, leading to a globally consistent map.

In order to accurately manipulate such objects, robots need to know objects' full 6-DOF pose, which is made difficult by clutter and occlusions. Many household objects have regular structure that can be used to effectively guess object pose given an observation of just a small patch on the object. In this paper, we present a new method to model the spatial distribution of oriented local features on an object, which we use to infer object pose given small sets of observed local features. The orientation distribution for local features is given by a mixture of Binghams on the hypersphere of unit quaternions, while the local feature distribution for position given orientation is given by a locally-weighted (Quaternion kernel) likelihood.

This allows the use of computationally expensive batch optimisation techniques not usually associated with real-time operation: The result is a system that produces detailed maps with thousands of landmarks which can be tracked at frame-rate, with an accuracy and robustness rivalling that of state-of-the-art model-based systems.},

annote = {THIS PAPER IS GOOD FOR AN INTRODUCTION FOR PF

The paper describe particle filter by fusing data from an IMU and joint encoders to estimating pose of the end effector.

The purpose of this paper is to estimate the state vector of a three degree of freedom industrial robot 
using accelerometer and an encoder for each joint. The estimated state vector is used to generate appropriate control signal for the manipulators

Accelerometer are notorious for being nonlinear. Also, with encoder as the primary feedback for joint measurements, the state of the manipulator becomes non-linear and uncertain. The uncertainty introduced from the sensors and the link material are managed using particle filtering technique.

The authors use particle filter to perform data fusion between an accelerometer and an encoder to estimate the pose of the end effector. Readers should note that both accelerometers and encoders has non-gaussian behavior. This is more pronounce if the joints are flexible which introduce nonlinearity to the state (position of the end effector) of the manipulator.

Particle filter is used simply because it is nonparametric. This mean that the parameter of a normal distribution are not assumed. Instead, PF perform the estimation based on the sampled data and generate the distribution from these samples. The method of sampling provide a general solution that has no presumption of sensor characteristics. This also means that with particle filters, more accessable sensors such as an accelerometer or an IMU can be used without scaling down accuracy. 

The state vector estimation was compared with extended kalman filtering technique. The authors observe higher accuracy in estimation of the state vector for PF compared to EKF technique. However, the author caution the selection of particles numbers may improve accuracy with the expense of computational load.},

abstract = {We present a new mechanism for passive wing morphing of flapping wings inspired by bat and bird wing morphology. The mechanism consists of an unactuated hand wing connected to the arm wing with a wrist joint. Flapping motion generates centrifugal accelerations in the hand wing, forcing it to unfold passively. Using a robotic model in hover, we made kinematic measurements of unfolding kinematics as functions of the non-dimensional wingspan fold ratio (2–2.5) and flapping frequency (5–17 Hz) using stereo high-speed cameras. We find that the wings unfold passively within one to two flaps and remain unfolded with only small amplitude oscillations. To better understand the passive dynamics, we constructed a computer model of the unfolding process based on rigid body dynamics, contact models, and aerodynamic correlations. This model predicts the measured passive unfolding within about one flap and shows that unfolding is driven by centrifugal acceleration induced by flapping. The simulations also predict that relative unfolding time only weakly depends on flapping frequency and can be reduced to less than half a wingbeat by increasing flapping amplitude. Subsequent dimensional analysis shows that the time required to unfold passively is of the same order of magnitude as the flapping period. This suggests that centrifugal acceleration can drive passive unfolding within approximately one wingbeat in small and large wings. Finally, we show experimentally that passive unfolding wings can withstand impact with a branch, by first folding and then unfolding passively. This mechanism enables flapping robots to squeeze through clutter without sophisticated control. Passive unfolding also provides a new avenue in morphing wing design that makes future flapping morphing wings possibly more energy efficient and light-weight. Simultaneously these results point to possible inertia driven, and therefore metabolically efficient, control strategies in bats and birds to morph or recover within a beat.},

The proposed planner is based on probabilistic path planning techniques and it combines techniques originally designed for solving multiple-query and single-query problems. The planner first starts with a preprocessing stage that constructs a roadmap of valid paths with respect to the static obstacles. It then uses lazy-evaluation mechanisms combined with a single-query technique as local planner in order to rapidly update the roadmap according to the dynamic changes. This allows to answer queries quickly when the moving obstacles have little impact on the free-space connectivity. When the solution can not be found in the updated roadmap, the planner initiates a reinforcement stage that possibly results into the creation of cycles representing alternative paths that were not already stored in the roadmap. Simulation results show that this combination of techniques yields to efficient global planner capable of solving with a real-time performance problems in geometrically complex environments with moving obstacles.},

Sampling based planners provide an effective approach for solving high degree of freedom robot motion planning problems. The two most common algorithms are the Probabilistic Roadmap Method and Rapidly Exploring Random Trees. These standard techniques are well established, however they assume a fully known environment and generate paths ahead of time. For realistic applications a robot may be required to update its path in real-time as information is gained or obstacles change position. Variants of these standard algorithms designed for dynamic environments are categorically presented and common implementation strategies are explored.},

The answer springs directly from the fact that it is very rare to find a book that covers modeling with all types of differential equations in one volume. Until now. Mathematical Modeling: Models, Analysis and Applications covers modeling with all kinds of differential equations, namely ordinary, partial, delay, and stochastic. The book also contains a chapter on discrete modeling, consisting of differential equations, making it a complete textbook on this important skill needed for the study of science, engineering, and social sciences. More than just a textbook, this how-to guide presents tools for mathematical modeling and analysis. It offers a wide-ranging overview of mathematical ideas and techniques that provide a number of effective approaches to problem solving. Topics covered include spatial, delayed, and stochastic modeling. The text provides real-life examples of discrete and continuous mathematical modeling scenarios. MATLAB {\textregistered}},

abstract = {The advent of the smart grid promises to usher in an era that will bring intelligence, efficiency, and optimality to the power grid. Most of these changes will occur as an Internet-like communications network is superimposed on top of the current power grid using wireless mesh network technologies with the 802.15.4, 802.11, and WiMAX standards. Each of these will ex- pose the power grid to cybersecurity threats. In order to address this issue, this work proposes a distributed intrusion detection system for smart grids (SGDIDS) by developing and deploying an intelligent module, the analyzing module (AM), in multiple layers of the smart grid. Multiple AMs will be embedded at each level of the smart grid—the home area networks (HANs), neighborhood area networks (NANs), and wide area networks (WANs)—where they will use the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial immune system (AIS) to detect and classify malicious data and possible cyberattacks. AMs at each level are trained using data that is relevant to their level and will also be able to communicate in order to improve detection. Simulation results demonstrate that this is a promising methodology for supporting the optimal communication routing and improving system security through the identification of malicious network traffic.},

These are obtained by filtering over a large number of pixelwise small-baseline stereo comparisons. The explicitly scale-drift aware formulation allows the approach to operate on challenging sequences including large variations in scene scale. Major enablers are two key novelties: (1) a novel direct tracking method which operates on sim(3), thereby explicitly detecting scale-drift, and (2) an elegant probabilistic solution to include the effect of noisy depth values into tracking. The resulting direct monocular SLAM system runs in real-time on a CPU.},

abstract = {Engineers have for some time known that singularities play a significant role in the design and control of robot manipulators. Singularities of the kinematic mapping, which determines the position of the end–effector in terms of the manipulator's joint variables, may impede control algorithms, lead to large joint velocities, forces and torques and reduce instantaneous mobility. However they can also enable fine control, and the singularities exhibited by trajectories of the points in the end–effector can be used to mechanical advantage. A number of attempts have been made to understand kinematic singularities and, more specifically, singularities of robot manipulators, using aspects of the singularity theory of smooth maps. In this survey, we describe the mathematical framework for manipulator kinematics and some of the key results concerning singularities. A transversality theorem of Gibson and Hobbs asserts that, generically, kinematic mappings give rise to trajectories that display only singularity types up to a given codimension. However this result does not take into account the specific geometry of manipulator motions or, a fortiori , to a given class of manipulator. An alternative approach, using screw systems, provides more detailed information but also shows that practical manipulators may exhibit high codimension singularities in a stable way. This exemplifies the difficulties of tailoring singularity theory's emphasis on the generic with the specialized designs that play a key role in engineering.},

This method has proven very successful in practice, but the theoretical understanding of its performance is still limited. Assuming that a path $\gamma$ exists between two configurations u and b of the robot, we study the dependence of the failure probability to connect a and b on: 1) the length of $\gamma$; 2) the distance function of $\gamma$ from the obstacles; 3) the number of nodes N of the probabilistic roadmap constructed. Importantly, our results do not depend strongly on local irregularities of the configuration space, as was the case with previous analysis. These results are illustrated with a simple but illuminating example. In this example, we provide estimates for N, the principal parameter of the method, in order to achieve failure probability within prescribed bounds. We also compare, through this example, the different approaches to the analysis of the planning method.},

These can impair myocardial contractility and cause development and progression of heart failure (HF). Epidemiological studies have shown significant independent associations between OSA and HF. On the other hand, recent prospective observational studies reported a significant association between the presence of moderate to severe OSA and increased risk of mortality in patients with HF. In randomized trials, treating OSA with continuous positive airway pressure suppressed sympathetic activity, lowered BP, and improved myocardial systolic function in patients with HF. These data suggest the potential for treatment of OSA to improve clinical outcomes for patients with HF. However, large-scale randomized trials with sufficient statistical power will be needed to ascertain whether treatment of OSA will prevent development of, or reduce morbidity and mortality from HF.},

In this light, person re-identification is an important topic in scene monitoring, human computer interaction, retail, people counting, ambient assisted living and many other computer vision research. The existing datasets are not suitable for activity monitoring and human behaviour analysis. For this reason we build a novel dataset for person re-identification that uses an RGB-D camera in a top-view configuration. This setup choice is primarily due to the reduction of occlusions and it has also the advantage of being privacy preserving, because faces are not recorded by the camera. The use of an RGB-D camera allows to extract anthropometric features for the recognition of people passing under the camera. The paper describes in details the collection and construction modalities of the dataset TVPR. This is composed by 100 people and for each video frame nine depth and colour features are computed and provided together with key descriptive statistics.},

The basic problem takes live overlapping depth maps as input and incrementally fuses these into a single 3D model. This is challenging particularly when real-time performance is desired without trading quality or scale. We contribute an online system for large and fine scale volumetric reconstruction based on a memory and speed efficient data structure. Our system uses a simple spatial hashing scheme that compresses space, and allows for real-time access and updates of implicit surface data, without the need for a regular or hierarchical grid data structure. Surface data is only stored densely where measurements are observed. Additionally, data can be streamed efficiently in or out of the hash table, allowing for further scalability during sensor motion. We show interactive reconstructions of a variety of scenes, reconstructing both fine-grained details and large scale environments. We illustrate how all parts of our pipeline from depth map pre-processing, camera pose estimation, depth map fusion, and surface rendering are performed at real-time rates on commodity graphics hardware. We conclude with a comparison to current state-of-the-art online systems, illustrating improved performance and reconstruction quality.},

Using this alignment method, we\nobtain velocity estimates at a much higher accuracy than previous\nmethods. Through pre-filtering, we are able to achieve near real\ntime results. We also present an online method for real-time use\nwith accuracies close to that of the full method. We present a novel\napproach to quantitatively evaluate our velocity estimates by tracking\na parked car in a local reference frame in which it appears to be\nmoving relative to the ego vehicle. We use this evaluation method\nto automatically quantitatively evaluate our tracking performance\non 466 separate tracked vehicles. Our method obtains a mean absolute\nvelocity error of 0.27 m/s and an RMS error of 0.47 m/s on this test\nset. We can also qualitatively evaluate our method by building color\n3D car models from moving vehicles. We have thus demonstrated that\nour method can be used for precision car tracking with applications\nto autonomous driving and behavior modeling.},

abstract = {An industrial robot today uses measurements of its joint positions and models of its kinematics and dynamics to estimate and control its end-effector position. Substantially better end-effector position estimation and control performance would be obtainable if direct measurements of its end-effector position were also used. The subject of this paper is extended Kalman filtering for precise estimation of the position of the end-effector of a robot using, in addition to the usual measurements of the joint positions, direct measurements of the end-effector position. The estimation performances of extended Kalman filters are compared in applications to a planar two-axis robotic arm with very flexible links. The comparisons shed new light on the dependence of extended Kalman filter estimation performance on the quality of the model of the arm dynamics that the extended Kalman filter operates with.},
annote = {state estimation for end effector for robot with Flexible links

The authors uses extended kalman filter to estimate the position of the end effector of two axis robotic arm together with the joint measurement for highly flexible links in real time

UNCERTAINTY: the location of the end effector due to the flexible links 

SETUP: The authors use two link manipulator. Each joint has optical encoders and the end point has a reflective infrared-light emitter 

MODEL: The deflection of each links is modeled using the deflection beam model. 
The dynamic equations of the manipulator are derived from Kane's method.

LINEARIZATION: They linearixe the dynamic equation by eliminating the non-linear terms that involve the generalized elastic coordinates and their derivatives in the inertial matrix and the velocity vector. They coined the linearization method as a 'ruthless linearization'

The extended kalman filter is used to estimate the position of the end effector using the differential equation solution of the dynamic equation which was solved using Runge-Kutta method. 

Their result shows that with ruthlessly linearized model, the EKF can estimate the position of the end effector consistently during low-speed and high-speed slew maneuvers compared to continuosly linearized model of the dynamic model

THIS PAPER CAN BE USED AS AN ARGUMENT THAT LINEARIZATION OF MODEL BEFORE THE USE OF EKF AFFECTS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FILTERING TECHNIQUE.},

abstract = {Metal citrate gels of samarium and magnesium were used as precursors for the generation of hollow sphere particles by spray pyrolysis under mild thermal conditions. Six mixtures with different Sm/Mg ratios as well as pure Sm and Mg samples were prepared. As a result of the low synthesis temperature the particles consist of amorphous metal carboxylate networks. The texture of the shells is governed by microporosity yielding the major part of the total surface area. A detailed investigation of thermal decomposition, crystallization, and grain growth behavior was carried out under constant heating rate conditions. The decomposition products are nanocrystalline Sm2O3 and MgO and corresponding two-phase nanocomposites. The pure samarium carboxylate gel features considerably higher thermal stability compared with the one comprised of only magnesium. Accordingly the decomposition behavior of mixed samples is dependent on the Sm/Mg ratio. Furthermore it is shown that small amounts of MgO are able to slow down the kinetics of grain growth of Sm2O3 whereas high amounts are necessary to significantly reduce the final grain size at 1000 degrees C.},

Terror events can cause profound consequences for the whole society. Finding out the regularity of terrorist attacks has important meaning for the global counter-terrorism strategy. In the present study, we demonstrate a novel method using relatively popular and robust machine learning methods to simulate the risk of terrorist attacks at a global scale based on multiple resources, long time series and globally distributed datasets. Historical data from 1970 to 2015 was adopted to train and evaluate machine learning models. The model performed fairly well in predicting the places where terror events might occur in 2015, with a success rate of 96.6%. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the model with optimized tuning parameter values successfully predicted 2,037 terrorism event locations where a terrorist attack had never happened before.},

Traditional methods require expensive equipment with complex steps to calibrate kinematic parameters. Another issue is motion planning of the manipulator, which requires a map of the workspace. However, the mapping is time-consuming. In order to employ an efficient way to accomplish kinematic calibration and offer convenience to plan the motions of the manipulator, we study a new method called SKCLAM (Simultaneous Kinematic Calibration, Localization, and Mapping), which can calibrate the kinematic parameters of an industrial manipulator and achieve 3D environmental mapping simultaneously by employing an RGB-D camera attached to the end effector. In this paper, the true kinematic parameters were changed randomly to test and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in simulation.},

abstract = {Generally, information is the fundamental driver of assets pricing volatility in the financial market. This information can enter into the market either symmetrically or asymmetrically. The financial literature shows that Bitcoin market volatility is symmetrically informative and has a long memory to persist in the future. Additionally, the symmetricity of volatility has been revealed to be of greater sensitivity to its past values compared to the new shock of the market values. This study therefore applied the symmetric volatility structure of Bitcoin currency which can be measured through four input attributes such as open price (OP), high price (HP), low price (LP), and close price (CP) for predicting its price future trend. The study uses Rapid-Miner programme based on artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. The optimal model employs a multilayer neural network (NN) along with an “optimised operator” with the ability to locate the optimal factor loading of the applied algorithm. The findings indicate that ANN is an effective and adequate model for correctly predicting Bitcoin market prices using symmetric volatility attributes with accuracy level of 92.15% against the actual price, whereas the low price attribute is found to be the major promoter for Bitcoin price trend with percentage of 63%. This is followed by close price, high price, and open price with percentages of 49%, 46%, and 37%, respectively. The findings of the study therefore would be a valuable and significant input for commercial purposes among the cryptocurrency market players. In other worlds, based on these outcomes investors will proactively predicate the Bitcoin price trend and make the right investment decision either to buy, hold, or sale to gain up normal market return. This is considered a pioneering study that predicates the Bitcoin price trend based on its symmetric volatility structure. As these replication findings demonstrate, the proposed model is highly promising and applicable in a real-time trading system for predicting Bitcoin price future trend and maximising investment profits in Cryptocurrency markets.},

abstract = {This paper considers the problem of efficient computation of the spherical harmonic expansion, or Fourier transform, of functions defined on the two dimensional sphere, S2. The resulting algorithms are applied to the efficient computation of convolutions of functions on the sphere. We begin by proving convolution theorems generalizing well known and useful results from the abelian case. These convolution theorems are then used to develop a sampling theorem on the sphere. which reduces the calculation of Fourier transforms and convolutions of band-limited functions to discrete computations. We show how to perform these efficiently, starting with an O(n(log n)2) time algorithm for computing the Legendre transform of a function defined on the interval [-1,1] sampled at n points there. Theoretical and experimental results on the effects of finite precision arithmetic are presented. The Legendre transform algorithm is then generalized to obtain an algorithm for the Fourier transform, requiring O(n(log n)2) time, and an algorithm for its inverse in O(n1.5) time, where n is the number of points on the sphere at which the function is sampled. This improves the naive O(n2) bound, which is the best previously known. These transforms give an O(n1.5) algorithm for convolving two functions on the sphere. {\textcopyright} 1994 Academic Press, Inc. All rights reserved.},

Numerous strategies have been proposed in the literature regarding mobile robots but trajectory planning for manipulators is considerably more difficult since the entire structure can move and therefore produce collisions with surrounding obstacles. This paper presents an original solution and analytical comparison to path planning for manipulator arms. Path planning is executed in two parts: first, a global path is found to guide the end-effector in the environment using artificial potential fields and multi-resolution occupancy grids, then, a local path is determined for the entire robot structure by considering the kinematics of the robot as well as the repulsive forces of nearby obstacles in a fuzzy logic controller. Results are shown from a simulator that has been built for this purpose. The contribution of this research is to develop a robust solution for path planning with collision avoidance: one that can be used for various manipulator arms and environment configurations.},

abstract = {Robot Motion Planning (RMP) has been a thrust area of research in computing due to its complexity, since RMP in dynamic environments for a point robot with bounded velocity is an NP-hard problem. This paper is a critical review of the major contributions to RMP in dynamic environments. Between 1985 and 2015 the focus has changed from the classical approach to a heuristic approach. For velocity based motion planning in dynamic environments, ICS — AVOID (Fraichard and Asama, 2004, also see Section 2.4.4) is the safest approach which means that this method have the capability of for an autonomous robotic system to avoid collision with the obstacles in the environment. Other important approaches include artificial potential field based, artificial intelligence based, probabilistic based RMP and applications in areas of Agent systems and computer geometry. Classification of the RMP literature on the basis of the techniques and their performance has been attempted.},

abstract = {We address the problem of high speed autonomous navigation of quadrotor micro aerial vehicles with limited onboard sensing and computation. In particular, we propose a dual range planning horizon method to safely and quickly navigate quadrotors to specified goal locations in previously unknown and unstructured environments. In each planning epoch, a short-range planner uses a local map to generate a new trajectory. At the same time, a safe stopping policy is found. This allows the robot to come to an emergency halt when necessary. Our algorithm guarantees collision avoidance and demonstrates important advances in real-time planning. First, our novel short range planning method allows us to generate and re-plan trajectories that are dynamically feasible, comply with state and input constraints, and avoid obstacles in real-time. Further, previous planning algorithms abstract away the obstacle detection problem by assuming the instantaneous availability of geometric information about the environment. In contrast, our method addresses the challenge of using the raw sensor data to form a map and navigate in real-time. Finally, in addition to simulation examples, we provide physical experiments that demonstrate the entire algorithmic pipeline from obstacle detection to trajectory execution.},

Traditional methods require expensive equipment with complex steps to calibrate kinematic parameters. Another issue is motion planning of the manipulator, which requires a map of the workspace. However, the mapping is time-consuming. In order to employ an efficient way to accomplish kinematic calibration and offer convenience to plan the motions of the manipulator, we study a new method called SKCLAM (Simultaneous Kinematic Calibration, Localization, and Mapping), which can calibrate the kinematic parameters of an industrial manipulator and achieve 3D environmental mapping simultaneously by employing an RGB-D camera attached to the end effector. In this paper, the true kinematic parameters were changed randomly to test and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in simulation.},

Quaternions avoid the degeneracies of other 3-D orientation representations, while the Bingham distribution allows tracking of large-error (high-entropy) rotational distributions. Experimental comparison to a leading EKF-based filtering approach on both synthetic signals and a ball-tracking dataset shows that the Quaternion Bingham Filter (QBF) has lower tracking error than the EKF, particularly when the state is highly dynamic. We present two versions of the QBF-suitable for tracking the state of first-and second-order rotating dynamical systems.},

During the last decades, several methods and techniques, sophisticated or heuristic, have been presented to produce fast and realistic solutions to the IK problem. However, most of the currently available methods suffer from high computational cost and production of unrealistic poses. This report reviews and compares the most popular IK meth- ods regarding reliability, computational cost and conversion criteria, with a novel heuristic and iterative method, called Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK). FABRIK avoids the use of rotational angles or matrices, and instead finds each joint position via locating a point on a line. Thus, it converges in fewer iterations, has low computational cost and produces realistic poses. Constraints can easily be incorporated within the FABRIK methodology and multiple chains with multiple end effectors are also easily supported.},

abstract = {Distributed as an open-source library since 2013, real-time appearance-based mapping (RTAB-Map) started as an appearance-based loop closure detection approach with memory management to deal with large-scale and long-term online operation. It then grew to implement simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) on various robots and mobile platforms. As each application brings its own set of constraints on sensors, processing capabilities, and locomotion, it raises the question of which SLAM approach is the most appropriate to use in terms of cost, accuracy, computation power, and ease of integration. Since most of SLAM approaches are either visual- or lidar-based, comparison is difficult. Therefore, we decided to extend RTAB-Map to support both visual and lidar SLAM, providing in one package a tool allowing users to implement and compare a variety of 3D and 2D solutions for a wide range of applications with different robots and sensors. This paper presents this extended version of RTAB-Map and its use in comparing, both quantitatively and qualitatively, a large selection of popular real-world datasets (e.g., KITTI, EuRoC, TUM RGB-D, MIT Stata Center on PR2 robot), outlining strengths, and limitations of visual and lidar SLAM configurations from a practical perspective for autonomous navigation applications.},

The attraction of one firefly towards the other firefly due to variation of their brightness is the key concept of the proposed study. The proposed controller efficiently explores the environment and improves the global search in less number of iterations and hence it can be easily implemented for real time obstacle avoidance especially for dynamic environment. It solves the challenges of navigation, minimizes the computational calculations, and avoids random moving of fireflies. The performance of proposed controller is better in terms of path optimality when compared to other intelligent navigational approaches.},

Our system is capable of capturing comprehensive dense globally consistent surfel-based maps of room scale environments explored using an RGB-D camera in an incremental online fashion, without pose graph optimisation or any post-processing steps. This is accomplished by using dense frame-to-model camera tracking and windowed surfel-based fusion coupled with frequent model refinement through non-rigid surface deformations. Our approach applies local model-to-model surface loop closure optimisations as often as possible to stay close to the mode of the map distribution, while utilising global loop closure to recover from arbitrary drift and maintain global consistency.},

abstract = {A robot with a hand-mounted depth sensor scans a scene. When the robot's joint angles are not known with certainty, how can it best reconstruct the scene? In this work, we simultaneously estimate the joint angles of the robot and reconstruct a dense volumetric model of the scene. In this way, we perform simultaneous localization and mapping in the configuration space of the robot, rather than in the pose space of the camera. We show using simulations and robot experiments that our approach greatly reduces both 3-D reconstruction error and joint angle error over simply using the forward kinematics. Unlike other approaches, ours directly reasons about robot joint angles, and can use these to constrain the pose of the sensor. Because of this, it is more robust to missing or ambiguous depth data than approaches that are unconstrained by the robot's kinematics.},
annote = {The paper present a Simultaneous localization and mapping using a manipulator. Simultaneous localization and mapping involves obtaining a solution for pose estimation through map learning and vice versa simultaneously. 



The authors argue that encoders on each joints of a manipulator is not enough to estimate the end point of a manipulator due to gear trash, cable strechm non-rigid deformation and others.

The ARM-SLAM uses TSDF as part of the scene reconstruction to help estimate the pose of the end effector. TSDF is a variant of Dense Fusion 

They ARM-SLAM assume eye-in-hand configuration.

They conducted three experiments to validate their SLAM solution:
-2D simulation where they compare pose error between forward kinematics, Dense Fusion algorithm and ARM-SLAM algorithm. The result shows significant error reduction for both of the two algorithms compared to the forward kinematics calculation. ARM-SLAM, however, has the lowest errors.

-in their 3D simulation experiment, the authors compare results for forward kinematics calculation with kinect fusion and ARM-SLAM. They observed that ARM-SLAM is more robust when lost of data occurs.

-real shelf scanning experiments. In this experiment, the authors could not conclusively see better pose estimation with compared to the forward kinematics calculation. However, they reiterate that during lost of data, the ARM-SLAM solution produce robust estimation.

However, the paper does not deal with path planning},

abstract = {Large scale operational areas often require multiple service robots for coverage and task parallelism. In such scenarios, each robot keeps its individual map of the environment and serves specific areas of the map at different times. We propose a knowledge sharing mechanism for multiple robots in which one robot can inform other robots about the changes in map, like path blockage, or new static obstacles, encountered at specific areas of the map. This symbiotic information sharing allows the robots to update remote areas of the map without having to explicitly navigate those areas, and plan efficient paths. A node representation of paths is presented for seamless sharing of blocked path information. The transience of obstacles is modeled to track obstacles which might have been removed. A lazy information update scheme is presented in which only relevant information affecting the current task is updated for efficiency. The advantages of the proposed method for path planning are discussed against traditional method with experimental results in both simulation and real environments.},

abstract = {The concept of C-space entropy for sensor-based exploration and view planning for general robot-sensor systems has been introduced in [?], [?], [?], [?]. The robot plans the next sensing action (also called the next best view) to maximize the expected C-space entropy reduction, (known as Maximal expected Entropy Reduction, or MER). It gives priority to those areas that increase the maneuverable space around the robot, taking into account its physical size and shape, thereby facilitating reachability for further views. However, previous work had assumed a Poisson point process model for obstacle distribution in the physical space, a simplifying assumption. In this paper we derive an expression for MER criterion assuming an occupancy grid map, a commonly used representation for workspace representation in much of the mobile robot community. This model is easily obtained from typical range sensors such as laser range finders, stereo vision, etc., and furthermore, we can incorporate occlusion constraints and their effect in the MER formulation, making it more realistic. Simulations show that even for holonomic mobile robots with relatively simple geometric shapes (such as a rectangle), the MER criterion yields improvement in exploration efficiency (number of views needed to explore the C-space) over physical space based criteria.},

The determination of the SLAM problem has gained significant research momentum up to recent times. In this paper, firstly the problem of SLAM, its general model, framework, the difficulties, and leading approaches are described. Secondly, the progress of SLAM solving algorithms is surveyed throughout history. Pre-development, early SLAM solving algorithms, recent and present methods are presented and the progression of the state-of-art is reviewed based on the impact of leading approaches. We have selected some of the most important approaches of all time (1986–2019) to understand the research development, current trends, and intellectual structure of SLAM. Furthermore, from the trend of recent studies and the existence of difficult problems, a brief but sufficient review in the visual SLAM with the most outstanding approaches is presented. This paper provides one single sufficient review that allows researchers to understand the trend of SLAM, where it has come from, where it is going to and what needs to be more investigated in the SLAM-related field area. The future, in other words, the potential most important approaches inspiring the future researches in the SLAM problem can be seen. This paper will be an efficient overview and a valuable survey for introducing the SLAM solving approaches in mobile robotics as well as the general application of SLAM.},

abstract = {There are now a wide range of techniques that can be combined for image analysis. These include the use of object-based classifications rather than pixel-based classifiers, the use of LiDAR to determine vegetation height and vertical structure, as well terrain variables such as topographic wetness index and slope that can be calculated using GIS. This research investigates the benefits of combining these techniques to identify individual tree species. A QuickBird image and low point density LiDAR data for a coastal region in New Zealand was used to examine the possibility of mapping Pohutukawa trees which are regarded as an iconic tree in New Zealand. The study area included a mix of buildings and vegetation types. After image and LiDAR preparation, single tree objects were identified using a range of techniques including: a threshold of above ground height to eliminate ground based objects; Normalised Difference Vegetation Index and elevation difference between the first and last return of LiDAR data to distinguish vegetation from buildings; geometric information to separate clusters of trees from single trees, and treetop identification and region growing techniques to separate tree clusters into single tree crowns. Important feature variables were identified using Random Forest, and the Support Vector Machine provided the classification. The combined techniques using LiDAR and spectral data produced an overall accuracy of 85.4% (Kappa 80.6%). Classification using just the spectral data produced an overall accuracy of 75.8% (Kappa 67.8%). The research findings demonstrate how the combining of LiDAR and spectral data improves classification for Pohutukawa trees.},

These are obtained by filtering over a large number of pixelwise small-baseline stereo comparisons. The explicitly scale-drift aware formulation allows the approach to operate on challenging sequences including large variations in scene scale. Major enablers are two key novelties: (1) a novel direct tracking method which operates on sim(3), thereby explicitly detecting scale-drift, and (2) an elegant probabilistic solution to include the effect of noisy depth values into tracking.

Milios, Globally consistent range scan alignment for environment mapping, Autonomous Robots 4 (April) (1997) 333-349]. To create maps suitable for natural environments it is however necessary to consider the 6DoF pose case, namely the three Cartesian coordinates and the roll, pitch and yaw angles. This article describes the extension of the proposed algorithm to deal with these additional DoFs and the resulting non-linearities. Simplifications using Taylor expansion and Cholesky decomposition yield a fast application that handles the massive amount of 3D data and the computational requirements due to the 6DoF. Our experiments demonstrate the functionality of estimating the exact poses and their covariances in all 6DoF, leading to a globally consistent map.

@article{Kavraki1996,
abstract = {A new motion planning method for robots in static workspaces is presented. This method proceeds in two phases: a learning phase and a query phase. In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is constructed and stored as a graph whose nodes correspond to collision-free configurations and whose edges correspond to feasible paths between these configurations. These paths are computed using a simple and fast local planner. In the query phase, any given start and goal configurations of the robot are connected to two nodes of the roadmap; the roadmap is then searched for a path joining these two nodes. The method is general and easy to implement. It can be applied to virtually any type of holonomic robot. It requires selecting certain parameters (e.g., the duration of the learning phase) whose values depend on the scene, that is the robot and its workspace. But these values turn out to be relatively easy to choose. Increased efficiency can also be achieved by tailoring some components of the method (e.g., the local planner) to the considered robots. In this paper the method is applied to planar articulated robots with many degrees of freedom. Experimental results show that path planning can be done in a fraction of a second on a contemporary workstation ( 150 MIPS), after learning for relatively short periods of time (a few dozen seconds). 1996 IEEE.},

abstract = {RGB-D cameras that give an RGB image together with depth data have become widely available. In this paper, we use this data to build 3D point clouds of full indoor scenes such as an office and address the task of semantic la- beling of these 3D point clouds. We propose a graphical model that captures var- ious features and contextual relations, including the local visual appearance and shape cues, object co-occurence relationships and geometric relationships. With a large number of object classes and relations, the models parsimony becomes im- portant and we address that by using multiple types of edge potentials. The model admits efficient approximate inference, and we train it using a maximum-margin learning approach. In our experiments over a total of 52 3D scenes of homes and offices (composed from about 550 views, having 2495 segments labeled with 27 object classes), we get a performance of 84.06% in labeling 17 object classes for offices, and 73.38% in labeling 17 object classes for home scenes. Finally, we applied these algorithms successfully on a mobile robot for the task of finding objects in large cluttered rooms},

abstract = {Recently, the demand for more accurate, productive, and economical robot manipulators is increasing in the robotics industry. However, a manipulator will produce kinematic errors during production. Thus low-cost kinematic calibration is demanded. Moreover, environmental mapping is also demanded to plan the motions of the manipulator. In this paper, we proposed a simultaneous kinematic calibration, localization, and mapping (SKCLAM) method, which can simultaneously calibrate the kinematic parameters of an industrial robot manipulator using a commercial RGB-D camera attached to its end effector to reconstruct its surroundings. In our method, the kinematic calibration is achieved with feature detection and epipolor geometry. Synthetic and real data experiments were conducted to verify the SKCLAM method. We succeeded in reducing the kinematic errors of the manipulator and reconstructing dense 3D maps of the workspace in the experiments.},

abstract = {Detection and distance estimation of micro unmanned aerial vehicles (mUAVs) is crucial for (i) the detection of intruder mUAVs in protected environments; (ii) sense and avoid purposes on mUAVs or on other aerial vehicles and (iii) multi-mUAV control scenarios, such as environmental monitoring, surveillance and exploration. In this article, we evaluate vision algorithms as alternatives for detection and distance estimation of mUAVs, since other sensing modalities entail certain limitations on the environment or on the distance. For this purpose, we test Haar-like features, histogram of gradients (HOG) and local binary patterns (LBP) using cascades of boosted classifiers. Cascaded boosted classifiers allow fast processing by performing detection tests at multiple stages, where only candidates passing earlier simple stages are processed at the preceding more complex stages. We also integrate a distance estimation method with our system utilizing geometric cues with support vector regressors. We evaluated each method on indoor and outdoor videos that are collected in a systematic way and also on videos having motion blur. Our experiments show that, using boosted cascaded classifiers with LBP, near real-time detection and distance estimation of mUAVs are possible in about 60 ms indoors (1032 × 778 resolution) and 150 ms outdoors (1280 × 720 resolution) per frame, with a detection rate of 0.96 F-score. However, the cascaded classifiers using Haar-like features lead to better distance estimation since they can position the bounding boxes on mUAVs more accurately. On the other hand, our time analysis yields that the cascaded classifiers using HOG train and run faster than the other algorithms.},

abstract = {Local planning algorithms are an essential part of today's mobile robots and autonomous vehicle control. While global planning decides the route of the robot based on initial data given to the planner, local planning is a real-time motion control, based on the feedback from sensors. Its purpose is to keep the robot on an optimal track, following a plan provided by the global planner and to avoid unexpected obstacles. This makes local planning a fundamental part for safe robot navigation. The paper aims to compare three local planning algorithms: the Dynamic Window Approach, Enhanced Vector Field Histogram and Smooth Nearness-Diagram. The comparison was made on various maps in the Player/Stage system and with a real robot in SyRoTek (System for Robotic e-learning). A large set of experiments were made at first to find best configurations for the particular planning algorithms and the robot used. After that, another set of experiments with the found parameters was conducted to gain the results needed for comparison of the algorithms. More than 20,000 simulation runs and 120 hrs of experiments with a real robot were made in total giving the results good statistical credibility.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of motion planning for fast, agile flight through a dense obstacle field. A key contribution is the design of two families of motion primitives for aerial robots flying in dense obstacle fields, along with rules to stitch them together. The primitives are obtained by solving for the flight dynamics of the aerial robot, and explicitly account for limited agility using time delays. The first family of primitives consists of turning maneuvers to link any two points in space. The locations of the terminal points are used to obtain closed-form expressions for the control inputs required to fly between them, while accounting for the finite time required to switch between consecutive sets of control inputs. The second family consists of aggressive turn-around maneuvers wherein the time delay between the angle of attack and roll angle commands is used to optimize the maneuver for the spatial constraints. A 3-D motion planning algorithm based on these primitives is presented for aircraft flying through a dense forest.},

Six mixtures with different Sm/Mg ratios as well as pure Sm and Mg samples were prepared. As a result of the low synthesis temperature the particles consist of amorphous metal carboxylate networks. The texture of the shells is governed by microporosity yielding the major part of the total surface area. A detailed investigation of thermal decomposition, crystallization, and grain growth behavior was carried out under constant heating rate conditions. The decomposition products are nanocrystalline Sm2O3 and MgO and corresponding two-phase nanocomposites. The pure samarium carboxylate gel features considerably higher thermal stability compared with the one comprised of only magnesium. Accordingly the decomposition behavior of mixed samples is dependent on the Sm/Mg ratio. Furthermore it is shown that small amounts of MgO are able to slow down the kinetics of grain growth of Sm2O3 whereas high amounts are necessary to significantly reduce the final grain size at 1000 degrees C.},

In keeping with the conventional meaning of chapters and sections, I have reorganized the book into twenty-nine sections in seven chapters. The main additions are Section 20 on the Lie derivative and interior multiplication, two intrinsic operations on a manifold too important to leave out, new criteria in Section 21 for the boundary orientation, and a new appendix on quaternions and the symplectic group. Apart from correcting errors and misprints, I have thought through every proof again, clarified many passages, and added new examples, exercises, hints, and solu- tions. In the process, every section has been rewritten, sometimes quite drastically. The revisions are so extensive that it is not possible to enumerate themall here. Each chapter nowcomeswith an introductory essay giving an overviewofwhat is to come. To provide a timeline for the development of ideas, I have indicated whenever possi- ble the historical origin of the concepts, and have augmented the bibliography with historical references. Every author needs an audience. In preparing the second edition, I was partic- ularly fortunate to have a loyal and devoted audience of two, George F. Leger and Jeffrey D. Carlson, who accompanied me every step of the way. Section by section, they combed through the revision and gave me detailed comments, corrections, and suggestions. In fact, the two hundred pages of feedback that Jeff wrotewas in itself a masterpiece of criticism. Whatever clarity this book finally achieves results in a large measure from their effort. To both George and Jeff, I extend my sincere gratitude. I have also benefited from the comments and feedback of many other readers, includ- ing those of the copyeditor, David Kramer. Finally, it is a pleasure to thank Philippe Courr` ege, Mauricio Gutierrez, and Pierre Vogel for helpful discussions, and the In- stitut de Math´ ematiques de Jussieu and the Universit´ e Paris Diderot for hosting me during the revision.

For the next level of robot intelligence and intuitive user interaction, maps need to extend beyond geometry and appearance — they need to contain semantics. We address this challenge by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a state-of-the-art dense Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) system, ElasticFusion, which provides long-term dense correspondences between frames of indoor RGB-D video even during loopy scanning trajectories. These correspondences allow the CNN's semantic predictions from multiple view points to be proba-bilistically fused into a map. This not only produces a useful semantic 3D map, but we also show on the NYUv2 dataset that fusing multiple predictions leads to an improvement even in the 2D semantic labelling over baseline single frame predictions. We also show that for a smaller reconstruction dataset with larger variation in prediction viewpoint, the improvement over single frame segmentation increases. Our system is efficient enough to allow real-time interactive use at frame-rates of ≈25Hz.},

abstract = {Sampling-based algorithms are known for their ability to effectively compute paths for high-dimensional robots in relatively short times. The same algorithms, however, are also notorious for poor-quality solution paths, particularly as the dimensionality of the system grows. This work proposes a new probabilistically complete sampling-based algorithm, XXL, specially designed to plan the motions of high-dimensional mobile manipulators and related platforms. Using a novel sampling and connection strategy that guides a set of points mapped on the robot through the workspace, XXL scales to realistic manipulator platforms with dozens of joints by focusing the search of the robot's configuration space to specific degrees of freedom that affect motion in particular portions of the workspace. Simulated planning scenarios with the Robonaut2 platform and planar kinematic chains confirm that XXL exhibits competitive solution times relative to many existing works while obtaining execution-quality solution paths. Solutions from XXL are of comparable quality to cost-aware methods even though XXL does not explicitly optimize over any particular criteria, and are computed in an order of magnitude less time. Furthermore, observations about the performance of sampling-based algorithms on high-dimensional manipulator planning problems are presented that reveal a cautionary tale regarding two popular guiding heuristics used in these algorithms, indicating that a nearly random search may outperform the state-of-the-art when defining such heuristics is known to be difficult.},

Our system is capable of capturing comprehensive dense globally consistent surfel-based maps of room scale environments explored using an RGB-D camera in an incremental online fashion, without pose graph optimisation or any postprocessing steps. This is accomplished by using dense frame-tomodel camera tracking and windowed surfel-based fusion coupled with frequent model refinement through non-rigid surface deformations. Our approach applies local model-to-model surface loop closure optimisations as often as possible to stay close to the mode of the map distribution, while utilising global loop closure to recover from arbitrary drift and maintain global consistency},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a generalized framework for robustly operating previously unknown cabinets in kitchen environments. Our framework consists of the following four components: (1) a module for detecting both Lambertian and non-Lambertian (i.e. specular) handles, (2) a module for opening and closing novel cabinets using impedance control and for learning their kinematic models, (3) a module for storing and retrieving information about these objects in the map, and (4) a module for reliably operating cabinets of which the kinematic model is known. The presented work is the result of a collaboration of three PR2 beta sites. We rigorously evaluated our approach on 29 cabinets in five real kitchens located at our institutions. These kitchens contained 13 drawers, 12 doors, 2 refrigerators and 2 dishwashers. We evaluated the overall performance of detecting the handle of a novel cabinet, operating it and storing its model in a semantic map. We found that our approach was successful in 51.9 percent of all 104 trials. With this work, we contribute a well-tested building block of open-source software for future robotic service applications.},

The principal condition to resolve the problem is the stabilization of the vision of a flyer, which is inspired by a hovering passerine that experiences a substantial upward swing during downstroke periods while its eye remains stabilized. Viewing the aerodynamic force with a bird's eye, we find that the center and direction of this aerodynamic force vary continuously with respect to the lift force. Our results provide practical guidance for engineers to enhance the visual stability of surveillance cameras incorporated in micro aerial vehicles.},

These works have questioned the need of features, in which consolidated SLAM techniques of the last decade were based. In this paper we present a novel feature-based monocular SLAM system that is more robust, gives more accurate camera poses, and obtains comparable or better semi-dense reconstructions than the current state of the art. Our semi-dense mapping operates over keyframes, optimized by local bundle adjustment, allowing to obtain accurate triangulations from wide baselines. Our novel method to search correspondences, the measurement fusion and the inter-keyframe depth consistency tests allow to obtain clean reconstructions with very few outliers. Against the current trend in direct SLAM, our experiments show that by decoupling the semi-dense reconstruction from the trajectory computation, the results obtained are better. This opens the discussion on the benefits of features even if a semi-dense reconstruction is desired.},

Consequently, these methods have been extended further away from basic robot planning into further difficult scenarios and diverse applications. A comprehensive survey of the growing body of work in sampling-based planning is given here. Simulations are executed to evaluate some of the proposed planners and highlight some of the implementation details that are often left unspecified. An emphasis is placed on contemporary research directions in this field. We address planners that tackle current issues in robotics. For instance, real-life kinodynamic planning, optimal planning, replanning in dynamic environments, and planning under uncertainty are discussed. The aim of this paper is to survey the state of the art in motion planning and to assess selected planners, examine implementation details and above all shed a light on the current challenges in motion planning and the promising approaches that will potentially overcome those problems. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {An intuitive, yet precise introduction to probability theory, stochastic processes, and probabilistic models used in science, engineering, economics, and related fields. The 2nd edition is a substantial revision of the 1st edition, involving a reorganization of old material and the addition of new material. The length of the book has increased by about 25 percent. The main new feature of the 2nd edition is thorough introduction to Bayesian and classical statistics. The book is the currently used textbook for "Probabilistic Systems Analysis," an introductory probability course at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, attended by a large number of undergraduate and graduate students. The book covers the fundamentals of probability theory (probabilistic models, discrete and continuous random variables, multiple random variables, and limit theorems), which are typically part of a first course on the subject, as well as the fundamental concepts and methods of statistical inference, both Bayesian and classical. It also contains, a number of more advanced topics, from which an instructor can choose to match the goals of a particular course. These topics include transforms, sums of random variables, a fairly detailed introduction to Bernoulli, Poisson, and Markov processes. The book strikes a balance between simplicity in exposition and sophistication in analytical reasoning. Some of the more mathematically rigorous analysis has been just intuitively explained in the text, but is developed in detail (at the level of advanced calculus) in the numerous solved theoretical problems. Written by two professors of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and members of the prestigious US National Academy of Engineering, the book has been widely adopted for classroom use in introductory probability courses within the USA and abroad.From a Review of the 1st Edition:...it trains the intuition to acquire probabilistic feeling. This book explains every single concept it enunciates. This is its main strength, deep explanation, and not just examples that happen to explain. Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis leave nothing to chance. The probability to misinterpret a concept or not understand it is just... zero. Numerous examples, figures, and end-of-chapter problems strengthen the understanding. Also of invaluable help is the book's web site, where solutions to the problems can be found-as well as much more information pertaining to probability, and also more problem sets. --Vladimir Botchev, Analog Dialogue Several other reviews can be found in the listing of the first edition of this book.

abstract = {Real-time or online 3D reconstruction has wide applicability and receives further interest due to availability of consumer depth cameras. Typical approaches use a moving sensor to accumulate depth measurements into a single model which is continuously refined. Designing such systems is an intricate balance between reconstruction quality, speed, spatial scale, and scene assumptions. Existing online methods either trade scale to achieve higher quality reconstructions of small objects/scenes. Or handle larger scenes by trading real-time performance and/or quality, or by limiting the bounds of the active reconstruction. Additionally, many systems assume a static scene, and cannot robustly handle scene motion or reconstructions that evolve to reflect scene changes. We address these limitations with a new system for real-time dense reconstruction with equivalent quality to existing online methods, but with support for additional spatial scale and robustness in dynamic scenes. Our system is designed around a simple and flat point-Based representation, which directly works with the input acquired from range/depth sensors, without the overhead of converting between representations. The use of points enables speed and memory efficiency, directly leveraging the standard graphics pipeline for all central operations, i.e., camera pose estimation, data association, outlier removal, fusion of depth maps into a single denoised model, and detection and update of dynamic objects. We conclude with qualitative and quantitative results that highlight robust tracking and high quality reconstructions of a diverse set of scenes at varying scales.},

abstract = {Recent results in monocular visual-inertial navigation (VIN) have shown that optimization-based approaches outperform filtering methods in terms of accuracy due to their capability to relinearize past states. However, the improvement comes at the cost of increased computational complexity. In this paper, we address this issue by preintegrating inertial measurements between selected keyframes. The preintegration allows us to accurately summarize hundreds of inertial measurements into a single relative motion constraint. Our first contribution is a preintegration theory that properly addresses the manifold structure of the rotation group and carefully deals with uncertainty propagation. The measurements are integrated in a local frame, which eliminates the need to repeat the integration when the linearization point changes while leaving the opportunity for belated bias corrections. The second contribution is to show that the preintegrated IMU model can be seamlessly integrated in a visual-inertial pipeline under the unifying framework of factor graphs. This enables the use of a structureless model for visual measurements, further accelerating the computation. The third contribution is an extensive evaluation of our monocular VIN pipeline: experimental results confirm that our system is very fast and demonstrates superior accuracy with respect to competitive state-of-the-art filtering and optimization algorithms, including off-the-shelf systems such as Google Tango [1].},

They excel at both precision and speed in repetitive jobs and can cooperate with humans in complex tasks within dynamic environments. Self-localization is critical to any robot that must navigate or manipulate the environment. To solve this problem, a modular localization system suitable for mobile manipulators was developed. By using LIDAR data the proposed system is capable of achieving less than a centimeter in translation error and less than a degree in rotation error while requiring only 5 to 25 milliseconds of processing time. The system was tested in two different robot platforms at different velocities and in several cluttered and dynamic environments. It demonstrated high accuracy while performing pose tracking and high reliability when estimating the initial pose using feature matching. No artificial landmarks are required and it is able to adjust its operation rate in order to use very few hardware resources when a mobile robot is not moving.},

abstract = {A concise but rigorous treatment of variational techniques, focussing primarily on Lagrangian and Hamiltonian systems, this book is ideal for physics, engineering and mathematics students. The book begins by applying Lagrange's equations to a number of mechanical systems. It introduces the concepts of generalized coordinates and generalized momentum. Following this the book turns to the calculus of variations to derive the Euler-Lagrange equations. It introduces Hamilton's principle and uses this throughout the book to derive further results. The Hamiltonian, Hamilton's equations, canonical transformations, Poisson brackets and Hamilton-Jacobi theory are considered next. The book concludes by discussing continuous Lagrangians and Hamiltonians and how they are related to field theory. Written in clear, simple language and featuring numerous worked examples and exercises to help students master the material, this book is a valuable supplement to courses in mechanics.},

abstract = {In this work we address the problem of trajectory planning in Graph SLAM. We propose the use of Expected Value of the Final Uncertainty, which summarizes all the possible uncertainties that should be considered. In fully explored environments, this is used to determine the most reliable path to the final position. In partially explored environments, this criteria quantifies the reliability of the path planned in the free space. Tests demonstrate its ability to avoid unreliable paths in fully explored environments as compared to other uncertainty based criteria. In the exploration scenario, potential paths not present in the original graph are proposed using Voronoi Diagram of the space ahead observed by the sensors. A cost function is proposed considering the length of the path as well as the expected final uncertainty, thus including potentially shorter, but still reliable paths. Tests demonstrate the shortest path is preferred as long as it contains loop closures with low uncertainty.},

This paper focuses on the study of the collision prediction of a dual-arm robot based on a 3D point cloud. Firstly, a self-identification method is presented based on the over-segmentation approach and the forward kinematic model of the robot. Secondly, a simplified 3D model of the robot is generated using the segmented point cloud. Finally, a collision prediction algorithm is proposed to estimate the collision parameters in real-time. Experimental studies using the Kinect sensor and the Baxter robot have been performed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.},
annote = {This paper present a method using point clouds to perform self-identification using k-means clustering method and obstacle detection and obstacle avoidance.

The point cloud are used to generate the skeleton and the sphere along the skeleton. The point clouds are sparse and noisy which introduce uncertaity to the self-identification. However, the uncertainty is eliminated using a filter based on the density of the point cloud

The detection of the obstacles are based on the negation of point clouds that are not a part of the skeleton and the sphere that shape the manipulator. This segmentation is the based of their approach to obstacle avoidance.

They tested their algorithm by performing three experiments sequentially using a Baxter manipulator robot with eye in hand configuration. These experiments involve the validation of their self-identification algorithm, obstacle detection algorithm, and obstacle avoidance algorithm. They compare their approach with another work by Rakprayoon et al. (2011) Kinect-based 
obstacle detection for manip-ulator. They report that their method manage to avoid collision even when the obstacle is close to the robot and eliminate unnecessary movements for obstacles far from the manipulator.},

Such a strong assumption limits the use of most visual SLAM systems in populated real-world environments, which are the target of several relevant applications like service robotics or autonomous vehicles. In this paper we present DynaSLAM, a visual SLAM system that, building over ORB-SLAM2 [1], adds the capabilities of dynamic object detection and background inpainting. DynaSLAM is robust in dynamic scenarios for monocular, stereo and RGB-D configurations. We are capable of detecting the moving objects either by multi-view geometry, deep learning or both. Having a static map of the scene allows inpainting the frame background that has been occluded by such dynamic objects. We evaluate our system in public monocular, stereo and RGB-D datasets. We study the impact of several accuracy/speed trade-offs to assess the limits of the proposed methodology. DynaSLAM outperforms the accuracy of standard visual SLAM baselines in highly dynamic scenarios. And it also estimates a map of the static parts of the scene, which is a must for long-term applications in real-world environments.},

abstract = {In this work, how a small bird (Japanese White-eye, Zosterops japonicus) executes a sharp turning maneuver is analyzed from a mechanical perspective. A specific type of turning maneuver, termed a 'hovering turn', was experimentally identified, which is evidently distinct from the yaw or bank turn that is well documented in the literature. The hovering turn is characterized by a turning radius only about $\sim$1/10 of the wingspan, and requires less than 0. 2 s. The reorientation of the bird's body is invariably preceded by a brief hovering stage during which the elevation angle of the bird increases from 40° to approximately 90°, leading beneficially to a considerable decrease (40% of its maximum) in the moment of inertia of the body against the axis of rotation. The brief hovering is deemed a strategic, preparatory and transitional stage in executing a roll-dominated turn that is efficient and particularly suitable for a small space. The mechanisms pertaining to the hovering turn might provide a useful, biomechanical inspiration to improve the maneuverability of artificial aerial vehicles. {\textcopyright} 2011 Society for Experimental Mechanics.},

It offers a comprehensive reference and text for Processing (www.processing.org), an open-source programming language that can be used by students, artists, designers, architects, researchers, and anyone who wants to program images, animation, and interactivity.Processing have been tested in classrooms, workshops, and arts institutions, including UCLA, Carnegie Mellon, New York University, and Harvard University. Tutorial units make up the bulk of the book and introduce the syntax and concepts of software (including variables, functions, and object-oriented programming), cover such topics as photography and drawing in relation to software, and feature many short, prototypical example programs with related images and explanations. More advanced professional projects from such domains as animation, performance, and typography are discussed in interviews with their creators. "Extensions" present concise introductions to further areas of investigation, including computer vision, sound, and electronics. Appendixes, references to other material, and a glossary contain additional technical details.

Often these subsystems are designed in a modular fashion and tested individually. However, when ultimately combined with other components to form a complete system, unexpected interactions between subsystems can occur that make it difficult to isolate the source of problems. This paper presents a novel paradigm for robot experimentation that enables unified testing of individual subsystems while acting as part of a complete whole made up of both virtual and real components. We exploit the recent advances in speed and accuracy of optical motion capture to localize the robot, track environment objects, and extract extrinsic parameters for moving cameras in real-time. We construct a world model representation that serves as ground truth for both visual and tactile sensors in the environment. From this data, we build spatial and temporal correspondences between virtual elements, such as motion plans, and real artifacts in the scene. The system enables safe, decoupled testing of component algorithms for vision, motion planning and control that would normally have to be tested simultaneously on actual hardware. We show results of successful online applications in the development of an autonomous humanoid robot.},

abstract = {Most of the existing robotic exploration schemes use occupancy grid representations and geometric targets known as frontiers. The occupancy grid representation relies on the assumption of independence between grid cells and ignores structural correlations present in the environment. We develop a Gaussian processes (GPs) occupancy mapping technique that is computationally tractable for online map building due to its incremental formulation and provides a continuous model of uncertainty over the map spatial coordinates. The standard way to represent geometric frontiers extracted from occupancy maps is to assign binary values to each grid cell. We extend this notion to novel probabilistic frontier maps computed efficiently using the gradient of the GP occupancy map. We also propose a mutual information-based greedy exploration technique built on that representation that takes into account all possible future observations. A major advantage of high-dimensional map inference is the fact that such techniques require fewer observations, leading to a faster map entropy reduction during exploration for map building scenarios. Evaluations using the publicly available datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed framework for robotic mapping and exploration tasks.},

The key idea of our approach is to evaluate uncertainty, represented by collision probability bounds, at multiple resolutions in different regions of the configuration space, depending on their relevance for finding a best path. Preliminary experimental results show that our approach is highly effective: our BURM algorithm is at least 40 times faster than an algorithm that tries to evaluate collision probabilities exactly, and it is not much slower than classic probabilistic roadmap planning algorithms, which ignore uncertainty in environment maps.},

abstract = {For long-term simultaneous planning, localization and mapping (SPLAM), a robot should be able to continuously update its map according to the dynamic changes of the environment and the new areas explored. With limited onboard computation capabilities, a robot should also be able to limit the size of the map used for online localization and mapping. This paper addresses these challenges using a memory management mechanism, which identifies locations that should remain in a Working Memory (WM) for online processing from locations that should be transferred to a Long-Term Memory (LTM). When revisiting previously mapped areas that are in LTM, the mechanism can retrieve these locations and place them back in WM for online SPLAM. The approach is tested on a robot equipped with a short-range laser rangefinder and a RGB-D camera, patrolling autonomously 10.5 km in an indoor environment over 11 sessions while having encountered 139 people.},

Common regional manipulator types are used to demonstrate the solutions. A numerical singularity analysis is presented for manipulators with the offset double universal joint wrist. The results point to the existence of coupled position and orientation singularities which are difficult to enumerate.

However, most approaches put their major focus on runtime and accuracy rather than on memory consumption, which becomes especially relevant when large-scale SLAM problems have to be solved. In this paper, we consider the SLAM problem from the point of view of memory consumption and present a novel approximate approach to SLAM with low memory consumption. Our approach achieves this based on a hierarchical decomposition consisting of small submaps with limited size. We perform extensive experiments on synthetic and publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that in situations in which the representation of the complete map requires more than the available main memory, our approach, in comparison to state-of-the-art exact solvers, reduces the memory consumption and the runtime up to a factor of 2 while still providing highly accurate maps.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2016. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.Birds morph their wings during a single wingbeat, across flight speeds and among flight modes. Such morphing may allow them to maximize aerodynamic performance, but this assumption remains largely untested. We tested the aerodynamic performance of swept and extended wing postures of 13 raptor species in three families (Accipitridae, Falconidae and Strigidae) using a propeller model to emulate mid-downstroke of flapping during take-off and a wind tunnel to emulate gliding. Based on previous research, we hypothesized that (1) during flapping, wing posture would not affect maximum ratios of vertical and horizontal force coefficients (CV:CH), and that (2) extended wings would have higher maximum CV:CH when gliding. Contrary to each hypothesis, during flapping, extended wings had, on average, 31% higher maximum CV:CHratios and 23% higher CV than swept wings across all biologically relevant attack angles ($\alpha$), and, during gliding, maximum CV:CH ratios were similar for the two postures. Swept wings had 11% higher CV than extended wings in gliding flight, suggesting flow conditions around these flexed raptor wings may be different from those in previous studies of swifts (Apodidae). Phylogenetic affiliation was a poor predictor of wing performance, due in part to high intrafamilial variation. Mass was only significantly correlated with extended wing performance during gliding. We conclude that wing shape has a greater effect on force per unit wing area during flapping at low advance ratio, such as takeoff, than during gliding.},

In this paper we present a novel feature-based monocular SLAM system that is more robust, gives more accurate camera poses, and obtains comparable or better semi-dense reconstructions than the cur- rent state of the art. Our semi-dense mapping operates over keyframes, optimized by local bundle adjustment, allowing to obtain accurate triangulations from wide baselines. Our novel method to search correspondences, the measurement fusion and the inter-keyframe depth consistency tests allow to obtain clean reconstructions with very few outliers. Against the current trend in direct SLAM, our experiments show that by decoupling the semi-dense reconstruction from the trajectory computation, the results obtained are better. This opens the discussion on the benefits of features even if a semi-dense reconstruction is desired.},

In order to deal with the different characteristics of the web data and the real robot data, we additionally use a small set of labeled point clouds and perform domain adaptation.

The texture of the shells is governed by microporosity yielding the major part of the total surface area. A detailed investigation of thermal decomposition, crystallization, and grain growth behavior was carried out under constant heating rate conditions. The decomposition products are nanocrystalline Sm2O3 and MgO and corresponding two-phase nanocomposites. The pure samarium carboxylate gel features considerably higher thermal stability compared with the one comprised of only magnesium. Accordingly the decomposition behavior of mixed samples is dependent on the Sm/Mg ratio. Furthermore it is shown that small amounts of MgO are able to slow down the kinetics of grain growth of Sm2O3 whereas high amounts are necessary to significantly reduce the final grain size at 1000 degrees C.},

In special, the problem of mapping complex environments, with features changing from tree-lined streets to urban areas with dense traffic, is studied. The robotic car is equipped with an odometry sensor, a 3D LiDAR Velodyne HDL-32E, a IMU, and a low cost GPS, and the data generated by these sensors are integrated in a pose-based GraphSLAM estimator. A new strategy for identification and correction of odometry data using evolutionary algorithms is presented. This new strategy makes odometry data significantly more consistent with GPS. Loop closures are detected using GPS data, and GICP, a 3D point cloud registration algorithm, is used to estimate the displacement between the different travels over the same region. After path estimation, 3D LiDAR data is used to build an occupancy grid mapping of the environment. A detailed mathematical description of how occupancy evidence can be calculated from the point clouds is given, and a submapping strategy to handle memory limitations is presented as well. The proposed framework is tested in three real world environments with different sizes, and features: a parking lot, a university beltway, and a city neighborhood. In all cases, satisfactory maps were built, with precise loop closures even when the vehicle traveled long distances between them.},

abstract = {The ability to simultaneously localize a robot and accurately map its surroundings is considered by many to be a key prerequisite of truly autonomous robots. However, few approaches to this problem scale up to handle the very large number of landmarks present in real environments. Kalman filter-based algorithms, for example, require time quadratic in the number of landmarks to incorporate each sensor observation. This paper presents FastSLAM, an algorithm that recursively estimates the full posterior distribution over robot pose and landmark locations, yet scales logarithmically with the number of landmarks in the map. This algorithm is based on a factorization of the posterior into a product of conditional landmark distributions and a distribution over robot paths. The algorithm has been run successfully on as many as 50,000 landmarks, environments far beyond the reach of previous approaches. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the FastSLAM algorithm on both simulated and real-world data.},

abstract = {Traditional simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms have been used to great effect in flat, indoor environments such as corridors and offices. We demonstrate that with a few augmentations, existing 2D SLAM technology can be extended to perform full 3D SLAM in less benign, outdoor, undulating environments. In particular, we use data acquired with a 3D laser range finder. We use a simple segmentation algorithm to separate the data stream into distinct point clouds, each referenced to a vehicle position. The SLAM technique we then adopt inherits much from 2D delayed state (or scan-matching) SLAM in that the state vector is an ever growing stack of past vehicle positions and inter-scan registrations are used to form measurements between them. The registration algorithm used is a novel combination of previous techniques carefully balancing the need for maximally wide convergence basins, robustness and speed. In addition, we introduce a novel post-registration classification technique to detect matches which have converged to incorrect local minima},

abstract = {In this lecture the group of rigid body motions is introduced via its representation on standard three dimensional Euclidian space. The relevance for robotics is that the links of a robot are usually modelled as rigid bodies. Moreover the payload of a robot is also usually a rigid body and hence much of robotics is concerned with understanding rigid transformations and sequences of these transformations. Chasles's theorem is presented, that is: a general rigid body motion is a screw motion, a rotation about a line in space followed by a translation along the line. The lower Reuleaux pairs are introduced. These are essentially surfaces which are invariant under some subgroup of rigid body motions. Such a surface can be the matting surface for a mechanical joint. In this way the basic mechanical joints used in robots can be classified. These surfaces turn out to have other applications in robotics. In robot gripping they are exactly the surfaces that cannot be immobilised using frictionless fingers. In robot vision the symmetries of these surfaces are motions which cannot be detected. Next Lie algebras are introduced. The 1-parameter rigid motions about a joint are considered. The correspondence between elements of the Lie algebra and 1-degree-of-freedom joints is given. The exponential map from the Lie algebra to the group is defined and used to describe the forward kinematics of a serial robot using the product of exponentials formula. The Rodrigues formula for the exponential map is derived using a set of mutually annihilating idempotents. The derivative of the exponential map is explored. In particular the Jacobian matrix for the forward kinematics is derived. More general results are also derived and these are used to show how the inverse kinematics problem can be cast as a set of ordinary differential equations.},

These works have questioned the need of features, in which consolidated SLAM techniques of the last decade were based. In this paper we present a novel feature-based monocular SLAM system that is more robust, gives more accurate camera poses, and obtains comparable or better semi-dense reconstructions than the cur- rent state of the art. Our semi-dense mapping operates over keyframes, optimized by local bundle adjustment, allowing to obtain accurate triangulations from wide baselines. Our novel method to search correspondences, the measurement fusion and the inter-keyframe depth consistency tests allow to obtain clean reconstructions with very few outliers. Against the current trend in direct SLAM, our experiments show that by decoupling the semi-dense reconstruction from the trajectory computation, the results obtained are better. This opens the discussion on the benefits of features even if a semi-dense reconstruction is desired.},

In this work we adapt a functional gradient approach for learning high-dimensional parameters of random fields in order to perform discrete, multi-label classification. With this approach we can learn robust models involving high-order interactions better than the previously used learning method. We validate the approach in the context of point cloud classification and improve the state of the art.

abstract = {Swifts are among the most aerodynamically refined gliding birds. However, the overlapping vanes and protruding shafts of their primary feathers make swift wings remarkably rough for their size. Wing roughness height is 1-2% of chord length on the upper surface-10,000 times rougher than sailplane wings. Sailplanes depend on extreme wing smoothness to increase the area of laminar flow on the wing surface and minimize drag for extended glides. To understand why the swift does not rely on smooth wings, we used a stethoscope to map laminar flow over preserved wings in a low-turbulence wind tunnel. By combining laminar area, lift, and drag measurements, we show that average area of laminar flow on swift wings is 69% (n = 3; std 13%) of their total area during glides that maximize flight distance and duration-similar to high-performance sailplanes. Our aerodynamic analysis indicates that swifts attain laminar flow over their rough wings because their wing size is comparable to the distance the air travels (after a roughness-induced perturbation) before it transitions from laminar to turbulent. To interpret the function of swift wing roughness, we simulated its effect on smooth model wings using physical models. This manipulation shows that laminar flow is reduced and drag increased at high speeds. At the speeds at which swifts cruise, however, swift-like roughness prolongs laminar flow and reduces drag. This feature gives small birds with rudimentary wings an edge during the evolution of glide performance.},

abstract = {How predators search for prey is a cornerstone question in behavioural ecology, which has yet to be investigated for animals foraging in 3D airspace. Do insectivorous birds such as swifts (Apodidae), swallows and martins (Hirundinidae) use similar strategies to those performed by terrestrial predators in 2D, or do they rely on different spatial search strategies because of some properties of the aerial open space? We addressed this question in the common swift, one of the most aerial birds, using a novel 3D optical tracking method. The analysis of fine-scale flight tracks revealed how birds distribute their presence in 3D space while foraging near their breeding colony. Common swifts concentrated the time spent per volume unit by adopting a tortuous path, and, to a much lesser extent, by decreasing their movement speed. By independently observing the birds' posture on tracking images, we were able to identify the occurrence of putative prey captures along flight tracks. We show that swifts' presence was concentrated mainly in the vicinity of prey captures, unveiling a volume-concentrated search (VCS) strategy in this aerial insectivore. This is an extension in 3D of the area-concentrated search classically described in terrestrial 2D space. VCS can (but does not necessarily) take place in thermal updrafts, where small insects can be concentrated in patches. In contrast to terrestrial and aquatic predators that can easily slow down or stop their movement in profitable places, a different speed–cost relationship underlying aerial movement prevents swifts from stopping in prey patches and explains why these birds rely mainly on movement tortuosity to perform intensive search. Our study thus shows how some physical properties of the environment can modulate the way an animal concentrates its search in profitable places.},

By including depth information into the framework, true objects boundaries can be found more easily, improving also the temporal coherency of the method.

abstract = {An obstacle avoidance and path planning algorithm for a multi-joint manipulator in a space robot is presented in this paper. In this paper, the end-effector of the manipulator is used to capture some special target in a space environment with obstacles. To ensure the safety of the operation, a collision-free path from the initial position to the target position is essential. Therefore, an obstacle avoidance and path planning algorithm based on the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm and the Forward and Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK) algorithm is presented in this paper. First, a path planning algorithm based on the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm is designed for the multi-joint manipulator. Further, a method to generate a random point by artificial guidance is introduced for a higher searching speed. The RRT algorithm can effectively explore the entire workspace and find a feasible path without collision for the end-effector. To calculate the positions of each joint, the Forward and Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK) algorithm is introduced and improved for the problem of inverse kinematics. The FABRIK algorithm avoids the use of rotational angles or matrices, and instead finds each joint position by locating a point on a line, and thus, it has a low computational cost. Therefore, the improved obstacle avoidance and path planning algorithm can quickly plan a feasible path for the multi-joint manipulator in a space environment with obstacles. A numerical simulation is carried out to analyze the proposed obstacle avoidance and path planning method. It is observed that the method finds a feasible path without collision for the multi-joint manipulator with a low computational cost. These results validated the effectiveness of the proposed method for path planning to avoid the obstacles.},

abstract = {Competing hypotheses about evolutionary origins of flight are the ‘fundamental wing-stroke' and ‘directed aerial descent' hypotheses. Support for the fundamental wing-stroke hypothesis is that extant birds use flapping of their wings to climb even before they are able to fly; there are no reported examples of incrementally increasing use of wing movements in gliding transitioning to flapping. An open question is whether locomotor styles must evolve initially for efficiency or if they might instead arrive due to efficacy. The proximal muscles of the avian wing output work and power for flight, and new research is exploring functions of the distal muscles in relation to dynamic changes in wing shape. It will be useful to test the relative contributions of the muscles of the forearm compared with inertial and aerodynamic loading of the wing upon dynamic morphing. Body size has dramatic effects upon flight performance. New research has revealed that mass-specific muscle power declines with increasing body mass among species. This explains the constraints associated with being large. Hummingbirds are the only species that can sustain hovering. Their ability to generate force, work and power appears to be limited by time for activation and deactivation within their wingbeats of high frequency. Most small birds use flap-bounding flight, and this flight style may offer an energetic advantage over continuous flapping during fast flight or during flight into a headwind. The use of flap-bounding during slow flight remains enigmatic. Flap-bounding birds do not appear to be constrained to use their primary flight muscles in a fixed manner. To improve understanding of the functional significance of flap-bounding, the energetic costs and the relative use of alternative styles by a given species in nature merit study. This article is part of the themed issue ‘Moving in a moving medium: new perspectives on flight'.},

abstract = {Traditional approaches to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) rely on low-level geometric features such as points, lines, and planes. They are unable to assign semantic labels to landmarks observed in the environment. Furthermore, loop closure recognition based on low-level features is often viewpoint-dependent and subject to failure in ambiguous or repetitive environments. On the other hand, object recognition methods can infer landmark classes and scales, resulting in a small set of easily recognizable landmarks, ideal for view-independent unambiguous loop closure. In a map with several objects of the same class, however, a crucial data association problem exists. While data association and recognition are discrete problems usually solved using discrete inference, classical SLAM is a continuous optimization over metric information. In this paper, we formulate an optimization problem over sensor states and semantic landmark positions that integrates metric information, semantic information, and data associations, and decompose it into two interconnected problems: an estimation of discrete data association and landmark class probabilities, and a continuous optimization over the metric states. The estimated landmark and robot poses affect the association and class distributions, which in turn affect the robot-landmark pose optimization. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated on indoor and outdoor datasets.},

abstract = {In the last years several direct (i.e. featureless) monocular SLAM approaches have appeared showing impressive semi-dense or dense scene reconstructions. These works have questioned the need of features, in which consolidated SLAM techniques of the last decade were based. In this paper we present a novel feature-based monocular SLAM system that is more robust, gives more accurate camera poses, and obtains comparable or better semi-dense reconstructions than the cur- rent state of the art. Our semi-dense mapping operates over keyframes, optimized by local bundle adjustment, allowing to obtain accurate triangulations from wide baselines. Our novel method to search correspondences, the measurement fusion and the inter-keyframe depth consistency tests allow to obtain clean reconstructions with very few outliers. Against the current trend in direct SLAM, our experiments show that by decoupling the semi-dense reconstruction from the trajectory computation, the results obtained are better. This opens the discussion on the benefits of features even if a semi-dense reconstruction is desired.},

abstract = {Autonomous, flexible, and human–robot collaboration are the key features of the next-generation robot. Such unstructured and dynamic environments bring great challenges in online adaptive path planning. The robots have to avoid dynamic obstacles and follow the original task path as much as possible. A robust and efficient online path planning method is required accordingly. A method based on the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR), and the Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) is proposed to overcome the above difficulties. During the offline stage, the GMM was used to model teaching data, and it can represent the offline-demonstrated motion and constraints. The optimal solution was encoded in the mean value, while the environmental constraints were encoded in the variance value. The GMR generated a smooth path with variance as the resample space according to the GMM of the teaching data. This representation isolated the old environment model with the novel obstacle. During the online stage, a Modified Probabilistic Roadmap (MPRM) was used to plan the motion locally. Because the GMM provides the distribution of all the feasible motion, the sampling space of the MPRM was generated by the variable density resampling method, and then, the roadmap was constructed according to the Euclidean and Probability Distance (EPD). The Dijkstra algorithm was used to search for the feasible path between the starting point and the target point. Finally, shortcut pruning and B-spline interpolation were used to generate a smooth path. During the simulation experiment, two obstacles were added to the recurrent scene to indicate the difference from the teaching scene, and the GMM/GMR-MPRM algorithm was used for path planning. The result showed that it can still plan a feasible path when the recurrent scene is not the same as the teaching scene. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm was verified on the IRB1200 robot experiment platform.},

The algorithm guarantees good robustness and accuracy for object detection through depth images. A standard planner plans collision-free trajectories throughout the whole task while a proposed reactive motion control is active. Distributed proximity sensors were adopted to locally modify the planned trajectory when unexpected or misplaced obstacles intervene in the scene. To implement a robust grasping phase, a novel slipping control algorithm was used. It dynamically computes the grasp force by adapting it to the actual object physical properties so as to prevent slipping. Experimental results carried out in a typical supermarket scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented methods.},

abstract = {Many geographic processes evolve in a three dimensional space and time continuum. However, when they are represented with the aid of geographic information systems (GIS) or geosimulation models they are modelled in a framework of two-dimensional space with an added temporal component. The objective of this study is to propose the design and implementation of voxel-based automata as a methodological approach for representing spatial processes evolving in the four-dimensional (4D) space–time domain. Similar to geographic automata models which are developed to capture and forecast geospatial processes that change in a two-dimensional spatial framework using cells (raster geospatial data), voxel automata rely on the automata theory and use three-dimensional volumetric units (voxels). Transition rules have been developed to represent various spatial processes which range from the movement of an object in 3D to the diffusion of airborne particles and landslide simulation. In addition, the proposed 4D models demonstrate that complex processes can be readily reproduced from simple transition functions without complex methodological approaches. The voxel-based automata approach provides a unique basis to model geospatial processes in 4D for the purpose of improving representation, analysis and understanding their spatiotemporal dynamics. This study contributes to the advancement of the concepts and framework of 4D GIS.},

To this end, a robust and scalable framework is provided composed of three main stages. In the first one, a probabilistic occupancy grid updated with a Hidden Markov Model used to maintain an up-to-date background and to extract moving persons. The second stage uses component labelling to identify and track persons in the scene. The last stage uses an hierarchical particle filter to estimate the body pose for each moving person. Occlusions are handled by querying the occupancy grid to identify hidden body parts so that they can be discarded from the pose estimation process. We provide a parallel implementation that runs on CPU and GPU at 4 frames per second. We also validate the approach on our own dataset that consists of synchronized motion capture with a single RGB-D camera data of a person performing ac-tions in challenging situations with severe occlusions generated by scene objects.

In contrast to the popular use of inertial measurements we propose to tightly-couple a dense RGB-D SLAM system with kinematic and odometry measurements from a wheeled robot equipped with a manipulator. The system has real-time capability while running on GPU. It optimizes the camera pose by considering the geometric alignment of the map as well as kinematic and odometric data from the robot. Through experimentation in the real-world, we show that the system is more robust to challenging trajectories featuring fast and loopy motion than the equivalent system without the additional kinematic and odometric knowledge, whilst retaining comparable performance to the equivalent RGB-D only system on easy trajectories.},

The algorithm generates a roadmap for an obstacle-free environment during a prepro- cessing stage. During the online planning stage blocked parts of the roadmap are in- validated and the roadmap is used for fast planning. Fast invalidation of blocked parts of the roadmap is accomplished through a mapping from occupied workspace grid cells to blocked roadmap parts. This workspace mapping is also generated during the pre- processing stage. It is shown that the implementation is able to plan within about 100 milliseconds while avoiding sensed obstacles, and, thus, is able to react to a dynamic environment. The path planner is implemented on the Care-O-bot 3, which is a home assistant robot developed at Fraunhofer IPA.},

abstract = {We present a novel approach for incorporating collision avoidance into trajectory optimization as a method of solving robotic motion planning problems. At the core of our approach are (i) A sequential convex optimization procedure, which penalizes collisions with a hinge loss and increases the penalty coefficients in an outer loop as necessary. (ii) An efficient formulation of the no-collisions constraint that directly considers continuous-time safety and enables the algorithm to reliably solve motion planning problems, including problems involving thin and complex obstacles. We benchmarked our algorithm against several other mo- tion planning algorithms, solving a suite of 7-degree-of-freedom (DOF) arm-planning problems and 18-DOF full-body planning problems. We compared against sampling-based planners from OMPL, and we also compared to CHOMP, a leading approach for trajectory optimization. Our algorithm was faster than the alternatives, solved more problems, and yielded higher quality paths. Experimental evaluation on the following additional problem types also confirmed the speed and effectiveness of our approach: (i) Planning foot placements with 34 degrees of freedom (28 joints + 6 DOF pose) of the Atlas humanoid robot as it maintains static stability and has to negotiate environmental constraints. (ii) Industrial box picking. (iii) Real-world motion planning for the PR2 that requires considering all degrees of freedom at the same time.},

These uncertainty prompts the use of two type of sensors as a visual feedback together with a tactile sensing

They use unscented Kalman filter to fuse image features that covers dense range, visual appearance, silhouette of manipulator arm, multi-figered hand and grasped object. To fuse these measurement, the authoers model three measurements. 
(1) measurement model for ahdn tracking by using apprearance, shape and silhouette
(2) object tracking measureent using point cloud association similar to iteratice closest points
(3) tactile measurement model to represent a binary state of contact between the fingers of the manipulator and the manipulated object

The experiment involves the tasks of grasping a hand-driller and drilling a red hole on a wooden block with the grasped drill.

Detected obstacles are aggregated in egocentric local multiresolution grid maps. Local maps are efficiently merged in order to simultaneously build global maps of the environment and localize in these.

abstract = {The precise localization of human operators in robotic workplaces is an important requirement to be satisfied in order to develop human-robot interaction tasks. Human tracking provides not only safety for human operators, but also context information for intelligent human-robot collaboration. This paper evaluates an inertial motion capture system which registers full-body movements of an user in a robotic manipulator workplace. However, the presence of errors in the global translational measurements returned by this system has led to the need of using another localization system, based on Ultra-WideBand (UWB) technology. A Kalman filter fusion algorithm which combines the measurements of these systems is developed. This algorithm unifies the advantages of both technologies: high data rates from the motion capture system and global translational precision from the UWB localization system. The developed hybrid system not only tracks the movements of all limbs of the user as previous motion capture systems, but is also able to position precisely the user in the environment.},

This paper uses kalman filter fusion algorithm to fuse ultra-wideband (UWB) technology and inertial motion capture system to estimate the motion of human operator in industrial environment. 

The algorithm improves the interaction between a robot and a human operator/user by localizing a human in a manipulator's workspace so that a cooperative interaction can be made. Since the authors use UWB sensor to estimate the location of the human, they use Kalman filtering technique to fuse the information coming from the UWB and the inertial sensors. The filtering technique compensate the low data rate of the UWB and the high error from inertial sensor. Their Kalman filter uses the global position of the UWB as the correction step and the inertial sensor as the prediction step.

Their result shows that by fusing two measurements using kalman filter algorithm, the state estimation of the person's location is increased in accuracy.},

abstract = {Model verification and validation (V&V) is an enabling methodology for the development of computational models that can be used to make engineering predictions with quantified confidence. Model V&V procedures are needed by government and industry to reduce the time, cost, and risk associated with full-scale test ing of products, materials, and weapon systems. Quantifying the confidence and predictive accuracy of model calculations provides the decision-maker with the information necessary for making high-consequence decisions. The development of guidelines and procedures for conducting a model V&V program are currently being defined by a broad spectrum of researchers. This report reviews the concepts involved in such a program. Model V&V is a current topic of great interest to both government and industry. In response to a ban on the production of new strategic weapons and nuclear testing, the Department of Energy (DOE) initiated the Science- Based Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP). An objective of the SSP is to maintain a high level of confidence in the safety, reliability, and performance of the existing nuclear weapons stockpile in the absence of nuclear testing. This objective has challenged the national laboratories to develop high-confidence tools and methods that can be used to provide credible models needed for stockpile certification via numerical simulation. There has been a significant increase in activity recent ly to define V&V methods and procedures. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) is working to develop fundamental concepts and terminology for V&V applied to high-level systems such as ballistic missile defense and battle management simulations. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) has recently formed a Standards Committee for the development of V&V procedures for computational solid mechanics models. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) has been a proponent of model V&V for all safety-related nuclear facility design, analyses, and operations. In fact, DNFSB 2002-1 1 recommends to the DOE and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) that a V&V process be performed for all safety related software and analysis. Model verification and validation are the primary processes for quantifying and building credibility in numerical models. Verification is the process of determining that a model implementation accurately represents the developer's conceptual description of the model and its solution. Validation is the process of determining the degree to which a model is an accurate representation of the real world from the perspective of the intended uses of the model. Both verification and validation are processes that accumulat e evidence of a model's correctness or accuracy for a specific scenario; thus, V&V cannot prove that a model is co rrect and accurate for all possible scenarios, but, rather, it can provide evidence that the model is sufficiently accurate for its intended use. vi Model V&V is fundamentally different from software V&V. Code developers developing computer programs perform software V&V to ensure code correctness, reliability, and robustness. In model V&V, the end product is a predictive model based on fundamental physics of the problem being solved. In all applications of practical interest, the calculations involved in obtaining solutions with the mode l require a computer code, e.g., finite element or finite difference analysis. Therefore, engineers seeking to devel op credible predictive models critically need model V&V guidelines and procedures. The expected outcome of the model V& V process is the quantified level of agreement between experimental data and model prediction, as well as the predictive accuracy of the model. This report attempts to describe the general philosophy, definitions, concepts, and processes for conducting a successful V&V program. This objective is motivated by the need for highly accurate numerical models for making predictions to support the SSP, and also by the lack of guidelines, standards and procedures for performing V&V for complex numerical models.},

Our approach is fully automated and relies on the extraction and analysis of the visual contours of the surrounding physical environment to successfully steer the MAV in hallways and to turn at intersections. All image analysis and processing necessary for deriving and controlling the flight trajectory take place off-board on a system external to the MAV. This permits the use of sophisticated multithreaded real-time algorithms that do not limit the speed of the drone. Furthermore, due to the elimination of on-board processing and possibly the use of additional sensors for realizing such autonomy, stock drones can be used and flight times realized on a single charge remain unaffected.

abstract = {A critical problem in mapping data is the frequent updating of large data sets. To solve this problem, the updating of small-scale data based on large-scale data is very effective. Various map generalization techniques, such as simplification, displacement, typification, elimination, and aggregation, must therefore be applied. In this study, we focused on the elimination and aggregation of the building layer, for which each building in a large scale was classified as “0-eliminated,” “1-retained,” or “2-aggregated.” Machine-learning classification algorithms were then used for classifying the buildings. The data of 1:1000 scale and 1:25,000 scale digital maps obtained from the National Geographic Information Institute were used. We applied to these data various machine-learning classification algorithms, including naive Bayes (NB), decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and support vector machine (SVM). The overall accuracies of each algorithm were satisfactory: DT, 88.96%; k-NN, 88.27%; SVM, 87.57%; and NB, 79.50%. Although elimination is a direct part of the proposed process, generalization operations, such as simplification and aggregation of polygons, must still be performed for buildings classified as retained and aggregated. Thus, these algorithms can be used for building classification and can serve as preparatory steps for building generalization.},

They developed a framework called Autonomous eXploration to BUild a Map (AXBAM). AXBAM define the uncertainty in an unknown environment as the measurement of information that has not been discovered in the environment by using Shanon's entropy definition of information theory. This is an appropriate concept to use in modeling an unknown environment since the theory help in optimizing the exploration and path planning of a manipulator. The authors use Occupancy Grid map concept to handle uncertainty for path plannin in the unknown environment based on the entropy definition. The authors implement ellipsoid force-field planner to plan collision free roadmap. 

Another problem addressed by the authors states that there are possibilities for multiple goal configuration and use their entropy model to arrive to a single goal configuration with the highest information gain prediction. 

Despite the use of occupancy map in managing the control of their manipulator under uncertain environment, the mapping model in this paper uses direct point clouds for detailed geometric representation of the unknown environment. However, the author fails to show any optimization of registrating local scans into a global scans. We believe without this optimization, if the pose of the end effector is uncertain, their map may have diverging misalignment. 

The authors uses Hokuyo Laser Range Finder (Hokuyo URG-04LX) as a scanning sensor attached on a six degrees of freedom Denso VM-6093 manipulator arm with eye-in-hand configuration. The 5th joint rotates to facilitate the intial scanning of the environment before exploration commence. Based on this intial scan, the robot will start exploring.

abstract = {The alula is a small structure located at the joint between the hand-wing and arm-wing of birds and is known to be used in slow flight with high angles of attack such as landing. It is assumed to function similarly to a leading-edge slat that increases lift and delays stall. However, in spite of its universal presence in flying birds and the wide acceptance of stall delay as its main function, how the alula delays the stall and aids the flight of birds remains unclear. Here, we investigated the function of alula on the aerodynamic performance of avian wings based on data from flight tasks and wind-tunnel experiments. With the alula, the birds performed steeper descending flights with greater changes in body orientation. Force measurements revealed that the alula increases the lift and often delays the stall. Digital particle image velocimetry showed that these effects are caused by the streamwise vortex, formed at the tip of the alula, that induces strong downwash and suppresses the flow separation over the wing surface. This is the first experimental evidence that the alula functions as a vortex generator that increases the lift force and enhances manoeuvrability in flights at high angles of attack.},

We also discuss first submissions to the benchmark that use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as a work horse, which already show remarkable performance improvements over state-of-the-art. CNNs have become the de-facto standard for many tasks in computer vision and machine learning like semantic segmentation or object detection in images, but have no yet led to a true breakthrough for 3D point cloud labelling tasks due to lack of training data. With the massive data set presented in this paper, we aim at closing this data gap to help unleash the full potential of deep learning methods for 3D labelling tasks. Our semantic3D.net data set consists of dense point clouds acquired with static terrestrial laser scanners. It contains 8 semantic classes and covers a wide range of urban outdoor scenes: churches, streets, railroad tracks, squares, villages, soccer fields and castles. We describe our labelling interface and show that our data set provides more dense and complete point clouds with much higher overall number of labelled points compared to those already available to the research community. We further provide baseline method descriptions and comparison between methods submitted to our online system. We hope semantic3D.net will pave the way for deep learning methods in 3D point cloud labelling to learn richer, more general 3D representations, and first submissions after only a few months indicate that this might indeed be the case.},

abstract = {Gliding flight performance and wake topology of a common swift (Apus apus L.) were examined in a wind tunnel at speeds between 7 and 11 m s(-1). The tunnel was tilted to simulate descending flight at different sink speeds. The swift varied its wingspan, wing area and tail span over the speed range. Wingspan decreased linearly with speed, whereas tail span decreased in a nonlinear manner. For each airspeed, the minimum glide angle was found. The corresponding sink speeds showed a curvilinear relationship with airspeed, with a minimum sink speed at 8.1 m s(-1) and a speed of best glide at 9.4 m s(-1). Lift-to-drag ratio was calculated for each airspeed and tilt angle combinations and the maximum for each speed showed a curvilinear relationship with airspeed, with a maximum of 12.5 at an airspeed of 9.5 m s(-1). Wake was sampled in the transverse plane using stereo digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). The main structures of the wake were a pair of trailing wingtip vortices and a pair of trailing tail vortices. Circulation of these was measured and a model was constructed that showed good weight support. Parasite drag was estimated from the wake defect measured in the wake behind the body. Parasite drag coefficient ranged from 0.30 to 0.22 over the range of airspeeds. Induced drag was calculated and used to estimate profile drag coefficient, which was found to be in the same range as that previously measured on a Harris' hawk.},

abstract = {When a robot manipulator performs tasks in a dynamic unstructured environment, it not only should account for where and how it should move, but also ensure that the robot can effectively avoid collisions with static and moving obstacles. Planning in absolutely unstructured and dynamic environment is much more challenging, up-to-date there is no universal solution to this problem. In this paper, we believed the concept that for motion planning in real dynamic environments, usually there is only a part of a path invalidated by obstacles, and only this part needs replanning. Thus, in this paper a practical strategy was presented for motion planning in dynamic environments. First, a variant dynamic Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner was designed to combine global planning with local replanning. Then, the proposed dynamic RRT algorithm was implemented under Robotic Operation System (ROS) framework and applied to a 7-degree-of-freedom manipulator. Experimental results have shown that the proposed dynamic RRT planner can plan and execute movement of robot manipulator between a starting and target position while preserving task constraints and reacting to environment changes in real time.},

A fast planner is necessary to enable the robot to react to quickly changing human environments. We have tested our implementation in real-world experiments where a human subject enters the manipulation area, is detected and safely avoided by the robot. This capability is critical for future applications in automation and service robotics where humans will work closely with robots to jointly perform tasks.},
annote = {This paper address changing in the workspace of a manipulator. They use dynamic roadmap (DRM) for path planning. They use midpoint workspace as workspace metric. They directly implement the point cloud from 3D sensor to check obstacle in a generate roadmap in a workspace. 

Preprocessing stage: The nodes of the roadmapts are created by sampling a 7-dimensional configuration space of the robot uniformly. These nodes are used to generate roadmaps from start to goal configuration. The initial generated roadmaps from these nodes are encapsulated with grid cells. 

Planning stage: During the planning stage, two search algorithm are used based on the predefined roadmaps. If an obstacle detected, via 3D sensor, near the grid cell that encapsulate the roadmap, or blocked part of the roadmap new path will be generated around the obstacle cell and new roadmaps are determined based on nodes that has been predetermined during preprocessing stage. To connect the start and the goal configuration of the manipulator, the authors use k nearest neighbors for each configuration

Experimentation setup: The authors use SwissRanger SR3000 with Care-O-bot 3. The preprocessing stage takes several hours but the the planning stage takes less than 100 ms to complete. The authors use two search algorithms to search the most optimal roadmap (least number of nodes), which are the A* and the Djikstra's algorithms. The authors conclude that A* search algorithm performs better thatn the Dijkstra algorithm when used with their methods of roadmap building.

We note that the path planning method used in this research only applicable for changes that involve static changes. However, despite being model based on largely open space, the authors remarked that their algorithm performs well even when the obtacles introduce narrow space roadmaps.},

abstract = {In a future intelligent factory, a robotic manipulator must work efficiently and safely in a Human–Robot collaborative and dynamic unstructured environment. Autonomous path planning is the most important issue which must be resolved first in the process of improving robotic manipulator intelligence. Among the path-planning methods, the Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm based on random sampling has been widely applied in dynamic path planning for a high-dimensional robotic manipulator, especially in a complex environment because of its probability completeness, perfect expansion, and fast exploring speed over other planning methods. However, the existing RRT algorithm has a limitation in path planning for a robotic manipulator in a dynamic unstructured environment. Therefore, an autonomous obstacle avoidance dynamic path-planning method for a robotic manipulator based on an improved RRT algorithm, called Smoothly RRT (S-RRT), is proposed. This method that targets a directional node extends and can increase the sampling speed and efficiency of RRT dramatically. A path optimization strategy based on the maximum curvature constraint is presented to generate a smooth and curved continuous executable path for a robotic manipulator. Finally, the correctness, effectiveness, and practicability of the proposed method are demonstrated and validated via a MATLAB static simulation and a Robot Operating System (ROS) dynamic simulation environment as well as a real autonomous obstacle avoidance experiment in a dynamic unstructured environment for a robotic manipulator. The proposed method not only provides great practical engineering significance for a robotic manipulator's obstacle avoidance in an intelligent factory, but also theoretical reference value for other type of robots' path planning.},

abstract = {Mosquitoes exhibit unusual wing kinematics; their long, slender wings flap at remarkably high frequencies for their size (>800 Hz)and with lower stroke amplitudes than any other insect group. This shifts weight support away from the translation-dominated, aerodynamic mechanisms used by most insects, as well as by helicopters and aeroplanes, towards poorly understood rotational mechanisms that occur when pitching at the end of each half-stroke. Here we report free-flight mosquito wing kinematics, solve the full Navier-Stokes equations using computational fluid dynamics with overset grids, and validate our results with in vivo flow measurements. We show that, although mosquitoes use familiar separated flow patterns, much of the aerodynamic force that supports their weight is generated in a manner unlike any previously described for a flying animal. There are three key features: leading-edge vortices (a well-known mechanism that appears to be almost ubiquitous in insect flight), trailing-edge vortices caused by a form of wake capture at stroke reversal, and rotational drag. The two new elements are largely independent of the wing velocity, instead relying on rapid changes in the pitch angle (wing rotation) at the end of each half-stroke, and they are therefore relatively immune to the shallow flapping amplitude. Moreover, these mechanisms are particularly well suited to high aspect ratio mosquito wings.},

A unique feature of this robot is that it uses wing articulation to control the flight path angle as well as the heading angle. It lacks a vertical tail for improved agility, which results in unstable lateral-directional dynamics. New closed-loop motion planning algorithms with guaranteed stability are obtained by rewriting the flight dynamic equations in the spatial domain rather than as functions of time, after which dynamic inversion is employed. It is shown that nonlinear dynamic inversion naturally leads to proportional-integral-derivative controllers, thereby providing an exact method for tuning the gains. The capabilities of the proposed bioinspired robot design and its novel closed-loop perching controller have been successfully demonstrated with perched landings on a human hand.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Position data has been recorded with a magnetic sensor-transmitter that has previously been aligned and synchronized with a commercial webcam, and we provide reliable ground-truth for 3D rotation and translation of the head with respect to the camera. In addition to this, an automatic face annotation procedure has been developed, which provides the image position of 54 facial landmarks, with negligible error, in every video frame in the database. This image ground-truth can be used for algorithm training or head tracking evaluation, among others. In order to show the usability of the database, we evaluate three head tracking approaches and three head models, and combine them to provide nine different head pose estimation sets of results. We show the validity of the presented database both for training and evaluation of head tracking and pose estimation methods, and provide an interesting comparison in performance of state-of-the-art algorithms. These results may also serve as reference to encourage other researchers to train and test their algorithms with this database, and compare their results with the ones presented in this paper.},

All the elements captured in the depth scene are recognized by means of an Ad-Hoc segmentation algorithm, which analyzes the raw depth data directly provided by the sensor. The system extracts the elements, and implements a solution to classify all the blobs in the scene. Anthropometric relationships and features are exploited to recognize one or more human subjects among the blobs. Once a person is detected, he is followed by a tracking algorithm between different frames. The use of a reference depth frame, containing the set-up of the scene, allows one to extract a human subject, even when he/she is interacting with other objects, such as chairs or desks. In addition, the problem of blob fusion is taken into account and efficiently solved through an inter-frame processing algorithm. A fall is detected if the depth blob associated to a person is near to the floor. Experimental tests show the effectiveness of the proposed solution, even in complex scenarios. {\textcopyright}2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {An investigation with computational fluid dynamics of the ground effect on a small bird revealed quantitatively the obstruction of the vortex expansion resulting from the presence of the ground at varied distance. Preceding authors focused mainly on the bird's wings, generally neglecting the bird's body; we discuss specifically the distinction of the aerodynamic effect between cases with and without the presence of the bird's body. The results of simulation show that, considering only two wings, for a distance between the wing model and the ground smaller than a semi-span, the smaller is the ground clearance, the more significant is the ground effect. At clearance 0.37 times a semi-span, the drag is decreased 11%, and the lift is increased 5.6%. The ground effect for an intact bird model composed of both wings and body is less effective than that for a simplified model with body omitted, because a suction was observed on the lower surface of the intact bird's trunk at clearance 0.37 times a semi-span; for this reason the intact bird model benefits less from the ground effect than the model with body excluded, but increased lift and decreased drag remain observable. This research treating the ground effect on a gliding bird reveals the importance of the presence of the bird's body in both computational and experimental models. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, R.O.C.},

However, they make restrictive assumptions that limit their applicability to manipulators operating in uncontrolled and partially unknown environments. This work describes how one of these assumptions - that the world is perfectly known - can be removed. We propose a utility-guided roadmap planner that incorporates uncertainty directly into the planning process. This enables the planner to identify configuration space paths that minimize uncertainty and, when necessary, efficiently pursue further exploration through utility-guided sensing of the workspace. Experimental results indicate that our utility-guided approach results in a robust planner even in the presence of significant error in its perception of the workspace. Furthermore, we show how the planner is able to reduce the amount of required sensing to compute a successful plan},

Their method is iterative; the planner consider and incomplete information about the world and constantly update changes in their map model and configuration space. 

The authors use the concept of utility and cost to weight the probability of an edge. A* algorithm is used to search the most optimal path from randomly sampled node in the configuration space. During edge validation of the roadmap is witheld before the A* algorithm complete its query. 

They validate their planner by simulating three seperate experiments, two of which, involve manipulators with ten degrees of freedom and fourteen degrees of freedom respectively. The planner is specified to solve 50 planning queries given a start and a goal configurations.

They report that building a planner on top of a occupancy grid map increase the accuracy of completing the path from the start configuration to the goal configuration.

abstract = {Competing hypotheses about evolutionary origins of flight are the ‘fundamental wing-stroke' and ‘directed aerial descent' hypotheses. Support for the fundamental wing-stroke hypothesis is that extant birds use flapping of their wings to climb even before they are able to fly; there are no reported examples of incrementally increasing use of wing movements in gliding transitioning to flapping. An open question is whether locomotor styles must evolve initially for efficiency or if they might instead arrive due to efficacy. The proximal muscles of the avian wing output work and power for flight, and new research is exploring functions of the distal muscles in relation to dynamic changes in wing shape. It will be useful to test the relative contributions of the muscles of the forearm compared with inertial and aerodynamic loading of the wing upon dynamic morphing. Body size has dramatic effects upon flight performance. New research has revealed that mass-specific muscle power declines with increasing body mass among species. This explains the constraints associated with being large. Hummingbirds are the only species that can sustain hovering. Their ability to generate force, work and power appears to be limited by time for activation and deactivation within their wingbeats of high frequency. Most small birds use flap-bounding flight, and this flight style may offer an energetic advantage over continuous flapping during fast flight or during flight into a headwind. The use of flap-bounding during slow flight remains enigmatic. Flap-bounding birds do not appear to be constrained to use their primary flight muscles in a fixed manner. To improve understanding of the functional significance of flap-bounding, the energetic costs and the relative use of alternative styles by a given species in nature merit study. This article is part of the themed issue ‘Moving in a moving medium: new perspectives on flight'.},

abstract = {Gliding birds continually change the shape and size of their wings, presumably to exploit the profound effect of wing morphology on aerodynamic performance. That birds should adjust wing sweep to suit glide speed has been predicted qualitatively by analytical glide models, which extrapolated the wing's performance envelope from aerodynamic theory. Here we describe the aerodynamic and structural performance of actual swift wings, as measured in a wind tunnel, and on this basis build a semi-empirical glide model. By measuring inside and outside swifts' behavioural envelope, we show that choosing the most suitable sweep can halve sink speed or triple turning rate. Extended wings are superior for slow glides and turns; swept wings are superior for fast glides and turns. This superiority is due to better aerodynamic performance-with the exception of fast turns. Swept wings are less effective at generating lift while turning at high speeds, but can bear the extreme loads. Finally, our glide model predicts that cost-effective gliding occurs at speeds of 8-10 m s(-1), whereas agility-related figures of merit peak at 15-25 m s(-1). In fact, swifts spend the night ('roost') in flight at 8-10 m s(-1) (ref. 11), thus our model can explain this choice for a resting behaviour. Morphing not only adjusts birds' wing performance to the task at hand, but could also control the flight of future aircraft.},

abstract = {The alula is a small structure located at the joint between the hand-wing and arm-wing of birds and is known to be used in slow flight with high angles of attack such as landing. It is assumed to function similarly to a leading-edge slat that increases lift and delays stall. However, in spite of its universal presence in flying birds and the wide acceptance of stall delay as its main function, how the alula delays the stall and aids the flight of birds remains unclear. Here, we investigated the function of alula on the aerodynamic performance of avian wings based on data from flight tasks and wind-tunnel experiments. With the alula, the birds performed steeper descending flights with greater changes in body orientation. Force measurements revealed that the alula increases the lift and often delays the stall. Digital particle image velocimetry showed that these effects are caused by the streamwise vortex, formed at the tip of the alula, that induces strong downwash and suppresses the flow separation over the wing surface. This is the first experimental evidence that the alula functions as a vortex generator that increases the lift force and enhances manoeuvrability in flights at high angles of attack.},

A unique feature of this robot is that it uses wing articulation to control the flight path angle as well as the heading angle. It lacks a vertical tail for improved agility, which results in unstable lateral-directional dynamics. New closed-loop motion planning algorithms with guaranteed stability are obtained by rewriting the flight dynamic equations in the spatial domain rather than as functions of time, after which dynamic inversion is employed. It is shown that nonlinear dynamic inversion naturally leads to proportional-integral-derivative controllers, thereby providing an exact method for tuning the gains. The capabilities of the proposed bioinspired robot design and its novel closed-loop perching controller have been successfully demonstrated with perched landings on a human hand.},

This permits the use of sophisticated multithreaded real-time algorithms that do not limit the speed of the drone.

abstract = {Mosquitoes exhibit unusual wing kinematics; their long, slender wings flap at remarkably high frequencies for their size (>800 Hz)and with lower stroke amplitudes than any other insect group. This shifts weight support away from the translation-dominated, aerodynamic mechanisms used by most insects, as well as by helicopters and aeroplanes, towards poorly understood rotational mechanisms that occur when pitching at the end of each half-stroke. Here we report free-flight mosquito wing kinematics, solve the full Navier-Stokes equations using computational fluid dynamics with overset grids, and validate our results with in vivo flow measurements. We show that, although mosquitoes use familiar separated flow patterns, much of the aerodynamic force that supports their weight is generated in a manner unlike any previously described for a flying animal. There are three key features: leading-edge vortices (a well-known mechanism that appears to be almost ubiquitous in insect flight), trailing-edge vortices caused by a form of wake capture at stroke reversal, and rotational drag. The two new elements are largely independent of the wing velocity, instead relying on rapid changes in the pitch angle (wing rotation) at the end of each half-stroke, and they are therefore relatively immune to the shallow flapping amplitude. Moreover, these mechanisms are particularly well suited to high aspect ratio mosquito wings.},

The tunnel was tilted to simulate descending flight at different sink speeds. The swift varied its wingspan, wing area and tail span over the speed range. Wingspan decreased linearly with speed, whereas tail span decreased in a nonlinear manner. For each airspeed, the minimum glide angle was found. The corresponding sink speeds showed a curvilinear relationship with airspeed, with a minimum sink speed at 8.1 m s(-1) and a speed of best glide at 9.4 m s(-1). Lift-to-drag ratio was calculated for each airspeed and tilt angle combinations and the maximum for each speed showed a curvilinear relationship with airspeed, with a maximum of 12.5 at an airspeed of 9.5 m s(-1). Wake was sampled in the transverse plane using stereo digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). The main structures of the wake were a pair of trailing wingtip vortices and a pair of trailing tail vortices. Circulation of these was measured and a model was constructed that showed good weight support. Parasite drag was estimated from the wake defect measured in the wake behind the body. Parasite drag coefficient ranged from 0.30 to 0.22 over the range of airspeeds. Induced drag was calculated and used to estimate profile drag coefficient, which was found to be in the same range as that previously measured on a Harris' hawk.},

Preceding authors focused mainly on the bird's wings, generally neglecting the bird's body; we discuss specifically the distinction of the aerodynamic effect between cases with and without the presence of the bird's body. The results of simulation show that, considering only two wings, for a distance between the wing model and the ground smaller than a semi-span, the smaller is the ground clearance, the more significant is the ground effect. At clearance 0.37 times a semi-span, the drag is decreased 11%, and the lift is increased 5.6%. The ground effect for an intact bird model composed of both wings and body is less effective than that for a simplified model with body omitted, because a suction was observed on the lower surface of the intact bird's trunk at clearance 0.37 times a semi-span; for this reason the intact bird model benefits less from the ground effect than the model with body excluded, but increased lift and decreased drag remain observable.

Morphing technologies offer aerodynamic benefits for an aircraft over a wide range of flight condi-tions.

Traditional mechanical and hydraulic systems are not considered good choices for morphing aircraft.

These characteristics offer researchers and designers new possibilities for designing morphing aircraft.

abstract = {We present a new mechanism for passive wing morphing of flapping wings inspired by bat and bird wing morphology. The mechanism consists of an unactuated hand wing connected to the arm wing with a wrist joint. Flapping motion generates centrifugal accelerations in the hand wing, forcing it to unfold passively. Using a robotic model in hover, we made kinematic measurements of unfolding kinematics as functions of the non-dimensional wingspan fold ratio (2–2.5) and flapping frequency (5–17 Hz) using stereo high-speed cameras. We find that the wings unfold passively within one to two flaps and remain unfolded with only small amplitude oscillations. To better understand the passive dynamics, we constructed a computer model of the unfolding process based on rigid body dynamics, contact models, and aerodynamic correlations. This model predicts the measured passive unfolding within about one flap and shows that unfolding is driven by centrifugal acceleration induced by flapping. The simulations also predict that relative unfolding time only weakly depends on flapping frequency and can be reduced to less than half a wingbeat by increasing flapping amplitude. Subsequent dimensional analysis shows that the time required to unfold passively is of the same order of magnitude as the flapping period. This suggests that centrifugal acceleration can drive passive unfolding within approximately one wingbeat in small and large wings. Finally, we show experimentally that passive unfolding wings can withstand impact with a branch, by first folding and then unfolding passively. This mechanism enables flapping robots to squeeze through clutter without sophisticated control. Passive unfolding also provides a new avenue in morphing wing design that makes future flapping morphing wings possibly more energy efficient and light-weight. Simultaneously these results point to possible inertia driven, and therefore metabolically efficient, control strategies in bats and birds to morph or recover within a beat.},

abstract = {More than a million insects and approximately 11,000 vertebrates utilize flapping wings to fly. However, flapping flight has only been studied in a few of these species, so many challenges remain in understanding this form of locomotion. Five key aerodynamic mechanisms have been identified for insect flight. Among these is the leading edge vortex, which is a convergent solution to avoid stall for insects, bats and birds. The roles of the other mechanisms - added mass, clap and fling, rotational circulation and wing-wake interactions - have not yet been thoroughly studied in the context of vertebrate flight. Further challenges to understanding bat and bird flight are posed by the complex, dynamic wing morphologies of these species and the more turbulent airflow generated by their wings compared with that observed during insect flight. Nevertheless, three dimensionless numbers that combine key flow, morphological and kinematic parameters - the Reynolds number, Rossby number and advance ratio - govern flapping wing aerodynamics for both insects and vertebrates. These numbers can thus be used to organize an integrative framework for studying and comparing animal flapping flight. Here, we provide a roadmap for developing such a framework, highlighting the aerodynamic mechanisms that remain to be quantified and compared across species. Ultimately, incorporating complex flight maneuvers, environmental effects and developmental stages into this framework will also be essential to advancing our understanding of the biomechanics, movement ecology and evolution of animal flight.},

abstract = {How predators search for prey is a cornerstone question in behavioural ecology, which has yet to be investigated for animals foraging in 3D airspace. Do insectivorous birds such as swifts (Apodidae), swallows and martins (Hirundinidae) use similar strategies to those performed by terrestrial predators in 2D, or do they rely on different spatial search strategies because of some properties of the aerial open space? We addressed this question in the common swift, one of the most aerial birds, using a novel 3D optical tracking method. The analysis of fine-scale flight tracks revealed how birds distribute their presence in 3D space while foraging near their breeding colony. Common swifts concentrated the time spent per volume unit by adopting a tortuous path, and, to a much lesser extent, by decreasing their movement speed. By independently observing the birds' posture on tracking images, we were able to identify the occurrence of putative prey captures along flight tracks. We show that swifts' presence was concentrated mainly in the vicinity of prey captures, unveiling a volume-concentrated search (VCS) strategy in this aerial insectivore. This is an extension in 3D of the area-concentrated search classically described in terrestrial 2D space. VCS can (but does not necessarily) take place in thermal updrafts, where small insects can be concentrated in patches. In contrast to terrestrial and aquatic predators that can easily slow down or stop their movement in profitable places, a different speed–cost relationship underlying aerial movement prevents swifts from stopping in prey patches and explains why these birds rely mainly on movement tortuosity to perform intensive search.

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of motion planning for fast, agile flight through a dense obstacle field. A key contribution is the design of two families of motion primitives for aerial robots flying in dense obstacle fields, along with rules to stitch them together. The primitives are obtained by solving for the flight dynamics of the aerial robot, and explicitly account for limited agility using time delays. The first family of primitives consists of turning maneuvers to link any two points in space. The locations of the terminal points are used to obtain closed-form expressions for the control inputs required to fly between them, while accounting for the finite time required to switch between consecutive sets of control inputs. The second family consists of aggressive turn-around maneuvers wherein the time delay between the angle of attack and roll angle commands is used to optimize the maneuver for the spatial constraints. A 3-D motion planning algorithm based on these primitives is presented for aircraft flying through a dense forest.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.Birds morph their wings during a single wingbeat, across flight speeds and among flight modes. Such morphing may allow them to maximize aerodynamic performance, but this assumption remains largely untested. We tested the aerodynamic performance of swept and extended wing postures of 13 raptor species in three families (Accipitridae, Falconidae and Strigidae) using a propeller model to emulate mid-downstroke of flapping during take-off and a wind tunnel to emulate gliding. Based on previous research, we hypothesized that (1) during flapping, wing posture would not affect maximum ratios of vertical and horizontal force coefficients (CV:CH), and that (2) extended wings would have higher maximum CV:CH when gliding. Contrary to each hypothesis, during flapping, extended wings had, on average, 31% higher maximum CV:CHratios and 23% higher CV than swept wings across all biologically relevant attack angles ($\alpha$), and, during gliding, maximum CV:CH ratios were similar for the two postures. Swept wings had 11% higher CV than extended wings in gliding flight, suggesting flow conditions around these flexed raptor wings may be different from those in previous studies of swifts (Apodidae). Phylogenetic affiliation was a poor predictor of wing performance, due in part to high intrafamilial variation. Mass was only significantly correlated with extended wing performance during gliding. We conclude that wing shape has a greater effect on force per unit wing area during flapping at low advance ratio, such as takeoff, than during gliding.},

The principal condition to resolve the problem is the stabilization of the vision of a flyer, which is inspired by a hovering passerine that experiences a substantial upward swing during downstroke periods while its eye remains stabilized. Viewing the aerodynamic force with a bird's eye, we find that the center and direction of this aerodynamic force vary continuously with respect to the lift force.

New closed-loop motion planning algorithms with guaranteed stability are obtained by rewriting the flight dynamic equations in the spatial domain rather than as functions of time, after which dynamic inversion is employed. It is shown that nonlinear dynamic inversion naturally leads to proportional-integral-derivative controllers, thereby providing an exact method for tuning the gains.

A specific type of turning maneuver, termed a 'hovering turn', was experimentally identified, which is evidently distinct from the yaw or bank turn that is well documented in the literature. The hovering turn is characterized by a turning radius only about $\sim$1/10 of the wingspan, and requires less than 0. 2 s. The reorientation of the bird's body is invariably preceded by a brief hovering stage during which the elevation angle of the bird increases from 40° to approximately 90°, leading beneficially to a considerable decrease (40% of its maximum) in the moment of inertia of the body against the axis of rotation. The brief hovering is deemed a strategic, preparatory and transitional stage in executing a roll-dominated turn that is efficient and particularly suitable for a small space. The mechanisms pertaining to the hovering turn might provide a useful, biomechanical inspiration to improve the maneuverability of artificial aerial vehicles. {\textcopyright} 2011 Society for Experimental Mechanics.},

abstract = {In this paper we develop reduced-order models for the unsteady lift on a pitching and plunging aerofoil over a range of angles of attack. In particular, we analyse the pitching and plunging dynamics for two cases: a two-dimensional flat plate at $\mathit{Re}= 100$ using high-fidelity direct numerical simulations and a three-dimensional NACA 0006 aerofoil at $\mathit{Re}= 65\hspace{0.167em} 000$ using wind-tunnel measurements. Models are obtained at various angles of attack and they are verified against measurements using frequency response plots and large-amplitude manoeuvres. These models provide a low-dimensional balanced representation of the relevant unsteady fluid dynamics. In simulations, flow structures are visualized using finite-time Lyapunov exponents. A number of phenomenological trends are observed, both in the data and in the models. As the base angle of attack increases, the boundary layer begins to separate, resulting in a decreased quasi-steady lift coefficient slope and a delayed relaxation to steady state at low frequencies. This extends the low-frequency range of motions that excite unsteady effects, meaning that the quasi-steady approximation is not valid until lower frequencies than are predicted by Theodorsen's classical inviscid model. In addition, at small angles of attack, the lift coefficient rises to the steady-state value after a step in angle, while at larger angles of attack, the lift coefficient relaxes down to the steady-state after an initially high lift state. Flow visualization indicates that this coincides with the formation and convection of vortices at the leading edge and trailing edge. As the angle of attack approaches the critical angle for vortex shedding, the poles and zeros of the model approach the imaginary axis in the complex plane, and some zeros cross into the right half plane. This has significant implications for active flow control, which are discussed. These trends are observed in both simulations and wind-tunnel data.},

abstract = {Inspired by birds flying through cluttered environments such as dense forests, this paper studies the theoretical foundations of a novel motion planning problem: high-speed navigation through a randomly-generated obstacle field when only the statistics of the obstacle generating process are known a priori. Resembling a planar forest environment, the obstacle generating process is assumed to determine the locations and sizes of disk-shaped obstacles. When this process is ergodic, and under mild technical conditions on the dynamics of the bird, it is shown that the existence of an infinite collision-free trajectory through the forest exhibits a phase transition. On one hand, if the bird flies faster than a certain critical speed, then, with probability one, there is no infinite collision-free trajectory, i.e., the bird will eventually collide with some tree, almost surely, regardless of the planning algorithm governing the bird's motion. On the other hand, if the bird flies slower than this critical speed, then there exists at least one infinite collision-free trajectory, almost surely. Lower and upper bounds on the critical speed are derived for the special case of a homogeneous Poisson forest considering a simple model for the bird's dynamics. For the same case, an equivalent percolation model is provided. Using this model, the phase diagram is approximated in Monte-Carlo simulations. This paper also establishes novel connections between robot motion planning and statistical physics through ergodic theory and percolation theory, which may be of independent interest.},

abstract = {Swifts are among the most aerodynamically refined gliding birds. However, the overlapping vanes and protruding shafts of their primary feathers make swift wings remarkably rough for their size. Wing roughness height is 1-2% of chord length on the upper surface-10,000 times rougher than sailplane wings. Sailplanes depend on extreme wing smoothness to increase the area of laminar flow on the wing surface and minimize drag for extended glides. To understand why the swift does not rely on smooth wings, we used a stethoscope to map laminar flow over preserved wings in a low-turbulence wind tunnel. By combining laminar area, lift, and drag measurements, we show that average area of laminar flow on swift wings is 69% (n = 3; std 13%) of their total area during glides that maximize flight distance and duration-similar to high-performance sailplanes. Our aerodynamic analysis indicates that swifts attain laminar flow over their rough wings because their wing size is comparable to the distance the air travels (after a roughness-induced perturbation) before it transitions from laminar to turbulent. To interpret the function of swift wing roughness, we simulated its effect on smooth model wings using physical models. This manipulation shows that laminar flow is reduced and drag increased at high speeds. At the speeds at which swifts cruise, however, swift-like roughness prolongs laminar flow and reduces drag. This feature gives small birds with rudimentary wings an edge during the evolution of glide performance.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to analyze and discuss the performance and stability of a tailless micro aerial vehicle with flexible articulated wings. The dihedral angles can be varied symmetrically on both wings to control the aircraft speed independently of the angle of attack and flight-path angle, while an asymmetric dihedral setting can be used to control yaw in the absence of a vertical tail.Anonlinear aeroelastic model is derived, and it is used to study the steadystate performance and flight stability of the micro aerial vehicle. The concept of the effective dihedral is introduced, which allows for a unified treatment of rigid and flexible wing aircraft. It also identifies the amount of elasticity that is necessary to obtain tangible performance benefits over a rigid wing. The feasibility of using axial tension to stiffen the wing is discussed, and, at least in the context of a linear model, it is shown that adding axial tension is effective but undesirable. The turning performance of an micro aerial vehicle with flexible wings is compared to an otherwise identical micro aerial vehicle with rigid wings. The wing dihedral alone can be varied asymmetrically to perform rapid turns and regulate sideslip. The maximum attainable turn rate for a given elevator setting, however, does not increase unless antisymmetric wing twisting is employed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011.},

Much of the research on tendon-driven Stewart platforms is devoted either to the completely restrained positioning mechanism (CRPM) or to one particular type of the incompletely restrained positioning mechanism (IRPM) where the external force is provided by the gravitational pull on the platform such as in cable-suspended Stewart platforms. An IRPM-based platform is proposed which uses the external force provided by a compliant member. The compliant central column allows the configuration to achieve n DOFs with n tendons. In particular, this investigation focuses on the angular deflection of the upper platform with respect to the lower platform. The application here is aimed at developing a linkable module that can be connected to one another so as to form a "snake robot" of sorts. Since locomotion takes precedence over positioning in this application, a 3-DOF Stewart platform is adopted. For an arbitrary angular displace of the end-effector, the corresponding length of each tendon can be determined through inverse kinematics.

abstract = {Many flying animals use both flapping and gliding flight as part of their routine behaviour. These two kinematic patterns impose conflicting requirements on wing design for aerodynamic efficiency and, in the absence of extreme morphing, wings cannot be optimised for both flight modes. In gliding flight, the wing experiences uniform incident flow and the optimal shape is a high aspect ratio wing with an elliptical planform. In flapping flight, on the other hand, the wing tip travels faster than the root, creating a spanwise velocity gradient. To compensate, the optimal wing shape should taper towards the tip (reducing the local chord) and/or twist from root to tip (reducing local angle of attack). We hypothesised that, if a bird is limited in its ability to morph its wings and adapt its wing shape to suit both flight modes, then a preference towards flapping flight optimization will be expected since this is the most energetically demanding flight mode. We tested this by studying a well-known flap-gliding species, the common swift, by measuring the wakes generated by two birds, one in gliding and one in flapping flight in a wind tunnel. We calculated span efficiency, the efficiency of lift production, and found that the flapping swift had consistently higher span efficiency than the gliding swift. This supports our hypothesis and suggests that even though swifts have been shown previously to increase their lift-to-drag ratio substantially when gliding, the wing morphology is tuned to be more aerodynamically efficient in generating lift during flapping. Since body drag can be assumed to be similar for both flapping and gliding, it follows that the higher total drag in flapping flight compared with gliding flight is primarily a consequence of an increase in wing profile drag due to the flapping motion, exceeding the reduction in induced drag.},

In this article, we evaluate vision algorithms as alternatives for detection and distance estimation of mUAVs, since other sensing modalities entail certain limitations on the environment or on the distance. For this purpose, we test Haar-like features, histogram of gradients (HOG) and local binary patterns (LBP) using cascades of boosted classifiers. Cascaded boosted classifiers allow fast processing by performing detection tests at multiple stages, where only candidates passing earlier simple stages are processed at the preceding more complex stages. We also integrate a distance estimation method with our system utilizing geometric cues with support vector regressors. We evaluated each method on indoor and outdoor videos that are collected in a systematic way and also on videos having motion blur. Our experiments show that, using boosted cascaded classifiers with LBP, near real-time detection and distance estimation of mUAVs are possible in about 60 ms indoors (1032 × 778 resolution) and 150 ms outdoors (1280 × 720 resolution) per frame, with a detection rate of 0.96 F-score. However, the cascaded classifiers using Haar-like features lead to better distance estimation since they can position the bounding boxes on mUAVs more accurately. On the other hand, our time analysis yields that the cascaded classifiers using HOG train and run faster than the other algorithms.},

In a previous study, it was shown that Theodorsen's and Wagner's unsteady aerodynamic models agree with force data from DNS for pitching and plunging maneuvers of a 2D at plate at Reynolds numbers between 100 and 300 as long as the reduced frequency k is not too large, k < 2, and the e ective angle-of-attack is below the critical angle. In this study reduced order models are obtained using an improved method, the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), which is more ecient to compute and ts within a standard control design framework. For test cases involving pitching and plunging motions, it is shown that Wagner's indicial response is closely approximated by ERA models of orders 4 and 6, respectively. All models are tested in a framework that decouples the longitudinal ight dynamic and aerodynamic models, so that the aerodynamics are viewed as an input-output system between wing kinematics and the forces generated.

abstract = {Micro aerial vehicles, such as multirotors, are particularly well suited for the autonomous monitoring, inspection, and surveillance of buildings, e.g., for maintenance or disaster management. Key prerequisites for the fully autonomous operation of micro aerial vehicles are real-time obstacle detection and planning of collision-free trajectories. In this article, we propose a complete system with a multimodal sensor setup for omnidirectional obstacle perception consisting of a three-dimensional (3D) laser scanner, two stereo camera pairs, and ultrasonic distance sensors. Detected obstacles are aggregated in egocentric local multiresolution grid maps. Local maps are efficiently merged in order to simultaneously build global maps of the environment and localize in these. For autonomous navigation, we generate trajectories in a multilayered approach: from mission planning over global and local trajectory planning to reactive obstacle avoidance. We evaluate our approach and the involved components in simulation and with the real autonomous micro aerial vehicle. Finally, we present the results of a complete mission for autonomously mapping a building and its surroundings.},

We propose the use of Expected Value of the Final Uncertainty, which summarizes all the possible uncertainties that should be considered. In fully explored environments, this is used to determine the most reliable path to the final position. In partially explored environments, this criteria quantifies the reliability of the path planned in the free space. Tests demonstrate its ability to avoid unreliable paths in fully explored environments as compared to other uncertainty based criteria. In the exploration scenario, potential paths not present in the original graph are proposed using Voronoi Diagram of the space ahead observed by the sensors. A cost function is proposed considering the length of the path as well as the expected final uncertainty, thus including potentially shorter, but still reliable paths. Tests demonstrate the shortest path is preferred as long as it contains loop closures with low uncertainty.},

abstract = {Many geographic processes evolve in a three dimensional space and time continuum. However, when they are represented with the aid of geographic information systems (GIS) or geosimulation models they are modelled in a framework of two-dimensional space with an added temporal component. The objective of this study is to propose the design and implementation of voxel-based automata as a methodological approach for representing spatial processes evolving in the four-dimensional (4D) space–time domain. Similar to geographic automata models which are developed to capture and forecast geospatial processes that change in a two-dimensional spatial framework using cells (raster geospatial data), voxel automata rely on the automata theory and use three-dimensional volumetric units (voxels). Transition rules have been developed to represent various spatial processes which range from the movement of an object in 3D to the diffusion of airborne particles and landslide simulation. In addition, the proposed 4D models demonstrate that complex processes can be readily reproduced from simple transition functions without complex methodological approaches. The voxel-based automata approach provides a unique basis to model geospatial processes in 4D for the purpose of improving representation, analysis and understanding their spatiotemporal dynamics. This study contributes to the advancement of the concepts and framework of 4D GIS.},

abstract = {A critical problem in mapping data is the frequent updating of large data sets. To solve this problem, the updating of small-scale data based on large-scale data is very effective. Various map generalization techniques, such as simplification, displacement, typification, elimination, and aggregation, must therefore be applied. In this study, we focused on the elimination and aggregation of the building layer, for which each building in a large scale was classified as “0-eliminated,” “1-retained,” or “2-aggregated.” Machine-learning classification algorithms were then used for classifying the buildings. The data of 1:1000 scale and 1:25,000 scale digital maps obtained from the National Geographic Information Institute were used. We applied to these data various machine-learning classification algorithms, including naive Bayes (NB), decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and support vector machine (SVM). The overall accuracies of each algorithm were satisfactory: DT, 88.96%; k-NN, 88.27%; SVM, 87.57%; and NB, 79.50%. Although elimination is a direct part of the proposed process, generalization operations, such as simplification and aggregation of polygons, must still be performed for buildings classified as retained and aggregated. Thus, these algorithms can be used for building classification and can serve as preparatory steps for building generalization.},

abstract = {The rapid and accurate assessment of building damage states using only post-event remote sensing data is critical when performing loss estimation in earthquake emergency response. Damaged roof detection is one of the most efficient methods of assessing building damage. In particular, airborne LiDAR is often used to detect roofs damaged by earthquakes, especially for certain damage types, due to its ability to rapidly acquire accurate 3D information on individual roofs. Earthquake-induced roof damages are categorized into surface damages and structural damages based on the geometry features of the debris and the roof structure. However, recent studies have mainly focused on surface damage; little research has been conducted on structural damage. This paper presents an original 3D shape descriptor of individual roofs for detecting roofs with surface damage and roofs exhibiting structural damage by identifying spatial patterns of compact and regular contours for intact roofs, as well as jagged and irregular contours for damaged roofs. The 3D shape descriptor is extracted from building contours derived from airborne LiDAR point clouds. First, contour clusters are extracted from contours that are generated from a dense DSM of individual buildings derived from point clouds. Second, the shape chaos indexes of contour clusters are computed as the information entropy through a contour shape similarity measurement between two contours in a contour cluster. Finally, the 3D shape descriptor is calculated as the weighted sum of the shape chaos index of each contour cluster corresponding to an individual roof. Damaged roofs are detected solely using the 3D shape descriptor with the maximum entropy threshold. Experiments using post-event airborne LiDAR point clouds of the 2010 Haiti earthquake suggest that the proposed damaged roof detection technique using the proposed 3D shape descriptor can detect both roofs exhibiting surface damage and roofs exhibiting structural damage with a high accuracy.},

abstract = {There are now a wide range of techniques that can be combined for image analysis. These include the use of object-based classifications rather than pixel-based classifiers, the use of LiDAR to determine vegetation height and vertical structure, as well terrain variables such as topographic wetness index and slope that can be calculated using GIS. This research investigates the benefits of combining these techniques to identify individual tree species. A QuickBird image and low point density LiDAR data for a coastal region in New Zealand was used to examine the possibility of mapping Pohutukawa trees which are regarded as an iconic tree in New Zealand. The study area included a mix of buildings and vegetation types. After image and LiDAR preparation, single tree objects were identified using a range of techniques including: a threshold of above ground height to eliminate ground based objects; Normalised Difference Vegetation Index and elevation difference between the first and last return of LiDAR data to distinguish vegetation from buildings; geometric information to separate clusters of trees from single trees, and treetop identification and region growing techniques to separate tree clusters into single tree crowns. Important feature variables were identified using Random Forest, and the Support Vector Machine provided the classification. The combined techniques using LiDAR and spectral data produced an overall accuracy of 85.4% (Kappa 80.6%). Classification using just the spectral data produced an overall accuracy of 75.8% (Kappa 67.8%). The research findings demonstrate how the combining of LiDAR and spectral data improves classification for Pohutukawa trees.},

It insists on the need for an integrated conception of such procedures, which must be tightly tailored to the specific robot that is used, notably to the capacities and limitations of its sensory-motor equipment, and to the specific environment that is experienced.

Satellite remote sensing has been demonstrated as an efficient tool to monitor the land cover patterns for a large spatial extent. Nevertheless, the demand on land cover maps at a finer scale (especially in urban areas) has been raised with evidence by numerous biophysical and socio-economic studies. This paper reviews the small-footprint LiDAR sensor - one of the latest high resolution airborne remote sensing technologies, and its application on urban land cover classification. While most of the early researches focus on the analysis of geometric components of 3D LiDAR data point clouds, there has been an increasing interest in investigating the use of intensity data, waveform data and multi-sensor data to facilitate land cover classification and object recognition in urban environment. In this paper, the advancement of airborne LiDAR technology, including data configuration, feature spaces, classification techniques, and radiometric calibration/correction is reviewed and discussed. The review mainly focuses on the LiDAR studies conducted during the last decade with an emphasis on identification of the approach, analysis of pros and cons, investigating the overall accuracy of the technology, and how the classification results can serve as an input for different urban environmental analyses. Finally, several promising directions for future LiDAR research are highlighted, in hope that it will pave the way for the applications of urban environmental modeling and assessment at a finer scale and a greater extent.},

We address this challenge by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a state-of-the-art dense Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) system, ElasticFusion, which provides long-term dense correspondences between frames of indoor RGB-D video even during loopy scanning trajectories. These correspondences allow the CNN's semantic predictions from multiple view points to be proba-bilistically fused into a map. This not only produces a useful semantic 3D map, but we also show on the NYUv2 dataset that fusing multiple predictions leads to an improvement even in the 2D semantic labelling over baseline single frame predictions. We also show that for a smaller reconstruction dataset with larger variation in prediction viewpoint, the improvement over single frame segmentation increases. Our system is efficient enough to allow real-time interactive use at frame-rates of ≈25Hz.},

The occupancy grid representation relies on the assumption of independence between grid cells and ignores structural correlations present in the environment. We develop a Gaussian processes (GPs) occupancy mapping technique that is computationally tractable for online map building due to its incremental formulation and provides a continuous model of uncertainty over the map spatial coordinates. The standard way to represent geometric frontiers extracted from occupancy maps is to assign binary values to each grid cell. We extend this notion to novel probabilistic frontier maps computed efficiently using the gradient of the GP occupancy map. We also propose a mutual information-based greedy exploration technique built on that representation that takes into account all possible future observations. A major advantage of high-dimensional map inference is the fact that such techniques require fewer observations, leading to a faster map entropy reduction during exploration for map building scenarios. Evaluations using the publicly available datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed framework for robotic mapping and exploration tasks.},

In this paper we present a novel feature-based monocular SLAM system that is more robust, gives more accurate camera poses, and obtains comparable or better semi-dense reconstructions than the cur- rent state of the art. Our semi-dense mapping operates over keyframes, optimized by local bundle adjustment, allowing to obtain accurate triangulations from wide baselines. Our novel method to search correspondences, the measurement fusion and the inter-keyframe depth consistency tests allow to obtain clean reconstructions with very few outliers. Against the current trend in direct SLAM, our experiments show that by decoupling the semi-dense reconstruction from the trajectory computation, the results obtained are better. This opens the discussion on the benefits of features even if a semi-dense reconstruction is desired.},

The robotic car is equipped with an odometry sensor, a 3D LiDAR Velodyne HDL-32E, a IMU, and a low cost GPS, and the data generated by these sensors are integrated in a pose-based GraphSLAM estimator. A new strategy for identification and correction of odometry data using evolutionary algorithms is presented. This new strategy makes odometry data significantly more consistent with GPS. Loop closures are detected using GPS data, and GICP, a 3D point cloud registration algorithm, is used to estimate the displacement between the different travels over the same region. After path estimation, 3D LiDAR data is used to build an occupancy grid mapping of the environment. A detailed mathematical description of how occupancy evidence can be calculated from the point clouds is given, and a submapping strategy to handle memory limitations is presented as well. The proposed framework is tested in three real world environments with different sizes, and features: a parking lot, a university beltway, and a city neighborhood. In all cases, satisfactory maps were built, with precise loop closures even when the vehicle traveled long distances between them.},

In addition, the proposed GP Semantic Map (GPSM) learns the structural and semantic correlation from measurements rather than resorting to assumptions, and can flexibly learn the spatial correlation as well as any additional non-spatial correlation between map points.

abstract = {We address the problem of high speed autonomous navigation of quadrotor micro aerial vehicles with limited onboard sensing and computation. In particular, we propose a dual range planning horizon method to safely and quickly navigate quadrotors to specified goal locations in previously unknown and unstructured environments. In each planning epoch, a short-range planner uses a local map to generate a new trajectory. At the same time, a safe stopping policy is found. This allows the robot to come to an emergency halt when necessary. Our algorithm guarantees collision avoidance and demonstrates important advances in real-time planning. First, our novel short range planning method allows us to generate and re-plan trajectories that are dynamically feasible, comply with state and input constraints, and avoid obstacles in real-time. Further, previous planning algorithms abstract away the obstacle detection problem by assuming the instantaneous availability of geometric information about the environment. In contrast, our method addresses the challenge of using the raw sensor data to form a map and navigate in real-time. Finally, in addition to simulation examples, we provide physical experiments that demonstrate the entire algorithmic pipeline from obstacle detection to trajectory execution.},

abstract = {Remote Sensing technologies are capable of providing high-resolution spatial data needed to set up advanced flood simulation models. Amongst them, aerial Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) surveys or Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS) systems have long been used to provide digital topographic maps. Nowadays, Remote Sensing data are commonly used to create Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) for detailed urban-flood modelling. However, the difficulty of relying on top-view LiDAR data only is that it cannot detect whether passages for floodwaters are hidden underneath vegetated areas or beneath overarching structures such as roads, railroads, and bridges. Such (hidden) small urban features can play an important role in urban flood propagation. In this paper, a complex urban area of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia was chosen as a study area to simulate the extreme flooding event that occurred in 2003. Three different DTMs were generated and used as input for a two-dimensional (2D) urban flood model. A top-view LiDAR approach was used to create two DTMs: (i) a standard LiDAR-DTM and (ii) a Filtered LiDAR-DTM taking into account specific ground-view features. In addition, a Structure from Motion (SfM) approach was used to detect hidden urban features from a sequence of ground-view images; these ground-view SfM data were then combined with top-view Filtered LiDAR data to create (iii) a novel Multidimensional Fusion of Views-Digital Terrain Model (MFV-DTM). These DTMs were then used as a basis for the 2D urban flood model. The resulting dynamic flood maps are compared with observations at six measurement locations. It was found that when applying only top-view DTMs as input data, the flood simulation results appear to have mismatches in both floodwater depths and flood propagation patterns. In contrast, when employing the top-ground-view fusion approach (MFV-DTM), the results not only show a good agreement in floodwater depth, but also simulate more correctly the floodwater dynamics around small urban feature. Overall, the new multi-view approach of combining top-view LiDAR data with ground-view SfM observations shows a good potential for creating an accurate digital terrain map which can be then used as an input for a numerical urban flood model.},

abstract = {Generally, information is the fundamental driver of assets pricing volatility in the financial market. This information can enter into the market either symmetrically or asymmetrically. The financial literature shows that Bitcoin market volatility is symmetrically informative and has a long memory to persist in the future. Additionally, the symmetricity of volatility has been revealed to be of greater sensitivity to its past values compared to the new shock of the market values. This study therefore applied the symmetric volatility structure of Bitcoin currency which can be measured through four input attributes such as open price (OP), high price (HP), low price (LP), and close price (CP) for predicting its price future trend. The study uses Rapid-Miner programme based on artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. The optimal model employs a multilayer neural network (NN) along with an “optimised operator” with the ability to locate the optimal factor loading of the applied algorithm. The findings indicate that ANN is an effective and adequate model for correctly predicting Bitcoin market prices using symmetric volatility attributes with accuracy level of 92.15% against the actual price, whereas the low price attribute is found to be the major promoter for Bitcoin price trend with percentage of 63%. This is followed by close price, high price, and open price with percentages of 49%, 46%, and 37%, respectively. The findings of the study therefore would be a valuable and significant input for commercial purposes among the cryptocurrency market players. In other worlds, based on these outcomes investors will proactively predicate the Bitcoin price trend and make the right investment decision either to buy, hold, or sale to gain up normal market return. This is considered a pioneering study that predicates the Bitcoin price trend based on its symmetric volatility structure. As these replication findings demonstrate, the proposed model is highly promising and applicable in a real-time trading system for predicting Bitcoin price future trend and maximising investment profits in Cryptocurrency markets.},
