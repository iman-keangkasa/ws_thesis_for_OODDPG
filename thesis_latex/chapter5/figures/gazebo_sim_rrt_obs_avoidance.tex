  \caption{The Gazebo Kinect simulation scene is shown
            in the 
            $gazebo\_simulation::/kinect/rgb/image\_color/compressed$ window
            and the feedback representation with octomap map model
            are shown in the backdrop of the figure. Voxelization coloring
            is based on the height value. Green voxel clustering shows 
            the representation of the static obstacle in the planning scene.
            In this diagram, the manipulator is in the fifth cycle space.}
