  \caption{The benchmark result when two configurations are defined and pass to 
  the OMPL planner pipeline. All planners completed a 50-cycle query from an initial
  pose to a goal pose. RRT requires the least amount of processing time at finding
  the motion planning solution, followed by the PRM.}
